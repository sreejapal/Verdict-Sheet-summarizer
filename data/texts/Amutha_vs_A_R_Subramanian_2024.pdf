                                                JUDGMENT
VIKRAM NATH, J.
1. The present appeal challenges the validity of the order dated 08.06.2018 passed by the Madras
High Court’s Madurai Bench in CMSA (MD) No. 34 of 2014 wherein the High Court allowed the
appeal of the respondent – husband herein, thereby setting aside the judgments of the two lower
Courts, and thus granting a decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. The appellant herein is the
wife challenging the grant of divorce.
2. The appellant and the respondent got married on 30.06.2002.
At the time of their marriage, the respondent was employed as a software engineer in Punjab. After
the marriage, the appellant moved to Chandigarh with the respondent and the respondent. The
couple lived together for a few months, SONIA BHASIN Date: 2024.12.20 18:51:39 IST Reason:
during which the appellant conceived a child. Subsequently, she returned to her
parental home for the delivery of the child.
On 09.07.2003, she gave birth to a female child. The respondent visited to see the
child, but when he requested the appellant to return to the matrimonial home, she
allegedly refused. Consequently, the respondent issued a legal notice for reunion on
29.12.2003, to which the appellant replied on 31.12.2003 with allegations against
him. Thereafter, the respondent filed a petition for restitution of conjugal rights in
January 2004, pending which attempts at reconciliation through a panchayat failed.
3. During the pendency of the restitution petition, the appellant agreed to resume cohabitation and
joined the respondent at his residence on 28.06.2004. The couple subsequently moved to

Bengaluru, Karnataka, where they resided together. However, the respondent alleged that the
appellant treated him with cruelty during this period. Eventually, the petition for restitution of
conjugal rights was dismissed for default. The appellant once again left the matrimonial home
allegedly without informing the respondent and returned to her parental home. The respondent
claimed that this desertion, combined with the mental anguish caused by her absence during the
demise of his father, amounted to cruelty. Consequently, the respondent filed a divorce petition in
2010 on the grounds of cruelty.
4. The appellant denied the allegations in the petition for dissolution of marriage and contended
that the respondent was at fault for failing to bring her back to the matrimonial home. She filed a
counterclaim for restitution of conjugal rights in her response before the Trial Court, expressing her
willingness to reconcile. Both parties presented their cases:
the respondent examined himself as PW1 and submitted twelve documents as
evidence, while the appellant testified as RW1 but did not produce any documentary
evidence. After evaluating the evidence, the Trial Court dismissed the respondent’s
divorce petition, holding that he has failed to establish that the appellant’s conduct
amounted to mental cruelty.
5. The respondent’s appeal against this decision was also dismissed by the First Appellate Court. The
First Appellate Court concurred with the Trial Court’s findings, observing that the respondent had
not proven that the appellant had voluntarily deserted him without cause or inflicted mental cruelty.
Instead, the First Appellate Court noted that the appellant had expressed a desire for reconciliation.
6. Challenging the findings and the judgment of the First Appellate Court, the respondent
approached the High Court. The High Court in its judgment reviewed the contentions of both the
parties, as well as the rulings of the Courts below. The respondent’ primary contention was that the
appellant had subjected him to cruelty, both mental and physical. He argued that her actions,
including filing false cases against him and deserting the matrimonial home, amounted to mental
cruelty. He further claimed that despite his repeated attempts to reconcile, the appellant remained
adamant and disinterested in reuniting, which led to the breakdown of the marriage. The
respondent emphasized that their separation, which had lasted for over ten years, demonstrated the
irretrievable breakdown of the marital relationship.
7. On the other hand, the appellant contended that the Courts below had correctly appreciated the
evidence and rightly dismissed the respondent’s claims for divorce. Her counsel before the High
Court argued that the alleged acts of cruelty were not substantiated with sufficient evidence and that
trivial disputes or normal wear and tear of married life could not constitute grounds for divorce. The
appellant maintained that the burden of proof rested on the respondent to demonstrate acts of
cruelty, which he failed to do. Furthermore, the appellant contended that there was no evidence to
suggest she had no interest in continuing the marital relationship, and the claims of cruelty were
unsubstantiated.

8. The High Court, in its findings, held that lodging false complaints against a spouse amounts to
mental cruelty. In this case, the wife had filed a criminal complaint alleging dowry harassment
against the husband and his family but later abandoned it without pursuing the matter further. The
Court inferred that the complaint was baseless and filed with intent to harass, constituting an act of
mental cruelty. Furthermore, the Court observed that the couple had been living separately for over
fifteen years by then, which demonstrated an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. Drawing
from judgments of this Court in Naveen Kohli vs. Neelu Kohli1, and Samar Ghosh vs. Jaya Ghosh2,
the High (2006)4 SCC 558 (2007)4 SCC 511 Court noted that such prolonged separation indicates
that the marital relationship is beyond repair and forcing the parties to remain in a dead marriage
would be neither just nor beneficial. Additionally, the High Court concluded that the appellant’s act
of leaving the matrimonial home without reasonable cause, coupled with her lack of interest in
reconciliation, amounted to desertion.
9. The High Court extensively analyzed the principles laid down by this Court, particularly in the
case of Samar Ghosh (Supra), which provides illustrative examples of mental cruelty. These
principles emphasize that mental cruelty is a subjective state of mind caused by prolonged anguish,
frustration, and emotional turmoil, which renders it unreasonable for spouses to cohabit.
10. The High Court observed that the appellant had filed a false criminal complaint accusing the
respondent and his family of dowry harassment. However, the appellant neither pursued the
complaint nor provided reasonable justification for her actions. Her conduct demonstrated malice
and intent to harass, causing mental agony to the respondent and his family. The High Court
inferred that this amounted to mental cruelty, as the complaint disrupted the matrimonial harmony
and caused significant emotional distress to the respondent.
11. The High Court also addressed the respondent’s claim of desertion. The appellant had been living
separately from the respondent for over fifteen years without valid reasons or attempts at
reconciliation. Although she filed a counterclaim seeking restitution of conjugal rights, she failed to
actively pursue it, revealing lack of genuine intent to resume marital cohabitation. Prolonged
separation, coupled with absence of any reasonable explanation, demonstrated the appellant’s
intention to permanently withdraw from the marital relationship. The High Court held that this
constituted desertion under the principles established by this Court, which define desertion as the
willful and permanent abandonment of matrimonial obligations without consent of the other
spouse.
12. The High Court also relied on precedents wherein this Court had held that filing false criminal
complaints and leveling unsubstantiated allegations amounts to mental cruelty. It emphasized that
false accusations erode trust and affection, irreparably damaging marital bond. Additionally, the
High Court observed that the appellant’s behavior caused an irreparable rift between the parties,
rendering their marriage broken beyond repair. Prolonged separation of over fifteen years, coupled
with lack of any effort to resolve disputes or reconcile, supported the conclusion that the marital
bond had become a legal fiction.

13. The High Court noted that the respondent’s efforts for reunion were unsuccessful, as the
appellant displayed indifference towards reconciliation. Her insistence on retrieving her belongings
from the matrimonial home and the absence of any subsequent action for restitution of conjugal
rights further illustrated her lack of interest in continuing the marriage. Her admission during
cross-examination that she had not taken any steps for reconciliation further strengthened the
conclusion that she was not genuinely invested in salvaging the marriage. The Court emphasized
that the factum of separation and animus deserendi, that is, the intention to desert, were
conclusively established, and in the absence of reasonable justification for her conduct, the
appellant’s actions amounted to both cruelty and desertion.
14. The High Court underscored that mental cruelty cannot be established through direct evidence
but must be inferred from the cumulative circumstances of the case. It observed that the appellant’s
behavior, including the filing of a false dowry harassment complaint and her prolonged separation
from the respondent, clearly fell within the parameters of mental cruelty as outlined in Samar Ghosh
(Supra). This included sustained reprehensible conduct, studied neglect, and indifference that
rendered cohabitation intolerable and caused significant mental anguish to the respondent.
15. Further, the High Court addressed the breakdown of the marriage, noting that the prolonged
separation of over fifteen years demonstrated that the marital relationship was beyond repair.
Relying on precedents such as Naveen Kohli (Supra), it held that maintaining the facade of marriage
under such circumstances serves no purpose and only perpetuates emotional distress for both
parties. The High Court emphasized that refusing to dissolve a marriage that has become defunct de
facto, despite its legal tie, undermines the sanctity of marriage and disregards the emotional
well-being of the parties.
16. Hence, the High Court found that the respondent had sufficiently established the grounds of
cruelty and desertion under Section 13(1)(ia) and (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 19553. It held that
the appellant’s false criminal complaint and her indifference to reconciliation efforts caused
significant mental agony to the respondent, amounting to cruelty. Additionally, her prolonged
separation without reasonable cause constituted desertion. The High Court dissolved the marriage
and set aside the decisions of the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court, granting a decree of
divorce to the husband. It noted that maintaining the marital tie under these circumstances was
contrary to public interest and the principles of justice, and therefore, the appeal was allowed.
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
17. The appellant contends that the High Court erred in reversing the concurrent findings of fact
established by the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court. According to the appellant, the High
Court overstepped its jurisdiction under Section 100 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 19084, which
allows intervention only in cases involving a substantial question of law. The appellant asserts that
the High Court introduced an entirely new ground—whether the marriage had irretrievably broken
down—without this issue being argued in the earlier proceedings. This, the appellant argues, goes
against established principles that the High Court cannot reappreciate evidence or interfere with
findings unless they are In short, ‘HMA’ In short, ‘CPC’ unsupported by evidence, based on a
Amutha vs A.R. Subramanian on 19 December, 2024

misreading of material evidence, or are manifestly unreasonable.
18. The appellant highlights that the respondent had not raised any grounds for interference with
the concurrent findings in the second appeal under Section 100, CPC. The appellant supports this
contention by citing the decision of this Court in State of Rajasthan & Ors. vs. Shiv Dayal & Anr5,
which reiterates the limited scope of second appeals. The appellant further argues that the First
Appellate Court had already conducted a detailed reappreciation of the evidence and reached a
reasoned conclusion. Therefore, the High Court lacked jurisdiction to revisit these findings.
19. The appellant also submits that the High Court erred in addressing the issue of condonation
under Section 23(1)(b) of HMA. Referring to this Court's decision in N.G. Dastane vs. S. Dastane6,
the appellant asserts that acts of cruelty or desertion were condoned when the parties reconciled and
resumed cohabitation after the filing of a complaint. The appellant emphasizes that the respondent
husband, during cross-examination, admitted that the death of his father was unrelated to the
appellant’s actions, undermining the claim of cruelty. The appellant argues that the High Court
failed to appreciate this evidence and incorrectly reversed the concurrent findings of the lower
Courts.
20. Lastly, the appellant underscores that the respondent did not seek divorce on the grounds of
desertion under Section (2019)8 SCC 637 (1975)2 SCC 326 13(1)(ib) of HMA but instead benefited
from his own wrongful actions. The appellant claims that the respondent deserted her and then
sought divorce on fabricated grounds. The appellant states that she does not wish to burden her
daughter with the stigma of divorce, nor is she seeking financial support from the respondent. She
simply wishes to uphold her dignity and safeguard her family’s reputation.
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
21. The respondent argues that the marriage has irretrievably broken down and should be dissolved
to allow both parties to move on with their lives. He submits that the appellant subjected him to
cruelty, including filing frivolous criminal complaints against him and his family. The respondent
claims that these complaints caused mental agony and created an irreparable rift between the
parties. The respondent asserts that the High Court rightly considered the irretrievable breakdown
of the marriage as a ground for divorce, even though it was not explicitly raised in the earlier
proceedings.
22. The respondent further contends that the appellant’s allegations of cruelty and desertion were
baseless and unsupported by evidence. He argues that the appellant lodged complaints against him
and his family, which amounted to harassment. Although there was an attempt at reconciliation, the
respondent maintains that the complaints caused lasting damage to the marital relationship. He
submits that the High Court correctly found that the complaints, even if later condoned, had a
significant impact on his mental well-being and justified dissolution of the marriage.
23. The respondent challenges the appellant’s reliance on concurrent findings of fact, arguing that
the High Court was justified in interfering because the lower Courts failed to consider critical

5
aspects of the evidence. He asserts that the Trial Court and the First Appellate Court ignored the
cumulative effect of the appellant’s conduct, which amounted to mental cruelty. The respondent
highlights that the High Court, in its judgment, noted these deficiencies and addressed the
substantial question of law concerning the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.
24. The respondent also argues that he has acted in good faith throughout the proceedings and has
consistently sought a resolution to the marital discord. He claims that the appellant’s unwillingness
to accept the breakdown of the marriage has prolonged the litigation unnecessarily. The respondent
submits that granting a divorce would not only end the prolonged legal battle but also allow both
parties to rebuild their lives independently.
ANALYSIS
25. We have heard Mrs. V. Mohana, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant and Ms.
Haripriya Padmanabhan, learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent.
26. Upon careful consideration of the submissions made by the parties and the facts established in
this case, this Court finds itself in agreement with the decision of the High Court, which granted a
decree of divorce in favor of the respondent husband. The appellant’s arguments centered around
procedural challenges under Section 100 of the CPC, and her insistence on reconciliation, fail to
address the core and undeniable realities of the marriage between the parties. On the contrary, the
evidence on record unequivocally demonstrates grounds of cruelty, prolonged separation, and an
irretrievable breakdown of the marital relationship. These grounds, coupled with legal precedents
cited by the High Court, leave no room for doubt that the marriage has lost its essence and that its
continuation would serve no meaningful purpose.
27. One of the primary grounds for the dissolution of the marriage is the appellant’s conduct, which
constitutes mental cruelty under Section 13(1)(ia) of HMA. The respondent has provided sufficient
evidence to show that the appellant was engaged in a pattern of behavior that caused him immense
mental and emotional distress. This included filing false and baseless criminal complaints against
the respondent and his family, which not only strained their relationship but also caused significant
damage to his reputation and peace of mind.
28. In N.G. Dastane (Supra), this Court laid down the principle that cruelty is not confined to
physical violence but also encompasses actions that inflict mental pain and suffering that creates a
reasonable apprehension of harm or injury to the aggrieved spouse from the conduct of the other
spouse so as to make it impossible for them to stay together. In the present case, the appellant’s
conduct, including the initiation of frivolous legal proceedings, falls squarely within the definition of
mental cruelty. The respondent’s claim is further supported by this Court’s judgment in Samar
Ghosh (Supra), wherein it was recognized that actions causing sustained emotional torment and loss
of trust in the marital relationship constitutes cruelty.
29. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the appellant’s actions were not isolated incidents but
formed a pattern of behavior that made cohabitation impossible. In V. Bhagat vs. D. Bhagat 7, this

Court emphasized that sustained and deliberate acts of cruelty make it unreasonable to expect one
spouse to continue living with the other.
30. The fact that the parties have been living separately for two decades now further reinforces the
conclusion that the marriage is no longer viable. Prolonged separation, as observed in K. Srinivas
Rao vs. D.A. Deepa8, creates a presumption of the marriage having irretrievably broken down. In
this case, the parties have not shared a marital life since 2004, and all attempts at reconciliation
have failed.
31. Marriage is a relationship built on mutual trust, companionship, and shared experiences. When
these essential elements are missing for an extended period, the marital bond becomes a mere legal
formality devoid of any substance. This Court has consistently held that prolonged separation,
coupled with inability to reconcile, is a relevant factor in deciding matrimonial disputes. In the
present case, the length of separation and the evident animosity between the parties (1994)1 SCC
337 (2013)5 SCC 226 make it clear that there is no possibility of the marriage being revived.
32. Although irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a statutory ground for divorce under the
HMA, this Court has, in appropriate cases, invoked its powers under Article 142 of the Constitution
of India to grant relief where the marriage is beyond repair. In Naveen Kohli (Supra), this Court
observed that when a marriage has irretrievably broken down, forcing the parties to remain together
serves no purpose and only prolongs their misery.
33. The evidence in the present case points unequivocally to an irretrievable breakdown of the
marriage. The appellant and the respondent have been embroiled in legal disputes for years, with no
signs of reconciliation. The respondent has expressed his desire to move on with his life, while the
appellant, despite her assertions to the contrary, has failed to demonstrate any genuine willingness
to repair the relationship. As held by this Court in Ashok Hurra vs. Rupa Bipin Zaveri 9 and Shilpa
Sailesh vs. Varun Sreenivasan10, prolonging a dead marriage serves no interest and only
perpetuates the agony of the parties involved.
34. It is evident from the record that continuation of the marriage would only lead to further
animosity and litigation, causing harm to both parties. The appellant’s insistence on reconciliation
appears to be more of a strategy to prolong the proceedings rather than a genuine effort to revive the
(1997)4 SCC 226 (2022) 15 SCC 754 relationship. In matrimonial disputes, this Court has
emphasized the need to prioritize welfare and dignity of both parties. Forcing a marriage to continue
when it has become a source of unhappiness and conflict undermines the very purpose of the
institution of marriage. In the present case, the interests of both the parties are best served by
allowing both parties to move on with their lives independently.
35. In view of the above, this Court upholds the judgment of the High Court granting a decree of
divorce to the respondent. The appellant’s submissions are rejected as lacking in merit, both on
procedural and substantive grounds. This Court reiterates that cruelty, long separation, and
irretrievable breakdown of marriage, as established in this case, and thus, provide sufficient
justification for dissolving the marriage.

36. While granting the decree of divorce, we deem it appropriate to award permanent alimony to the
appellant wife and the parties’ daughter. Although the appellant wife has not specifically claimed
any monetary relief or maintenance during these proceedings, it is trite and equitable to grant such
relief, considering the financial status of the parties, their professional backgrounds, and the larger
interest of justice. The financial independence of a party does not preclude the High Court from
granting maintenance if it is necessary to secure dignity, social standing, and financial stability post-
divorce, especially in cases where the marriage has subsisted for a long period.
37. It is undisputed that both, the appellant and the respondent are software engineers and were
earning handsomely at the time of their marriage more than two decades ago. It is reasonable to
infer that their respective incomes must have increased substantially over the years. However,
considering the dynamics of their separation and the financial burdens the appellant may have
borne during the protracted litigation, this Court finds it necessary to award her a lumpsum
permanent alimony of Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) to secure her financial
independence and ensure that she can lead her life with dignity. As observed in Kiran Jyot Maini vs.
Anish Pramod Patel 11, the concept of maintenance and alimony encompasses a right to sustenance
that allows the spouse to live in a manner suited to her status and standard of living, and the aim is
not to penalise the husband.
38. Further, this Court recognizes the responsibility of both parents toward the well-being,
education, and future prospects of their child. Although the daughter may be of an age where she is
approaching independence, the financial support provided through this judgment will be
instrumental in meeting her educational needs as well as expenses related to her future marriage. A
sum of Rs. 50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) is, therefore, awarded to the daughter for these
purposes. This is in line with the principles of safeguarding the interests of children suffering under
distress of such prolonged matrimonial disputes between the parents. Both parents share the duty of
ensuring the daughter's well-being and future security, and this financial provision will contribute to
fulfilling that duty.
(2024) SCC OnLine SC 1724
39. In granting permanent alimony and financial support, this Court is mindful of the principles laid
down in Rajnesh vs. Neha12. The factors to be considered while awarding maintenance or alimony
include the duration of the marriage, the earning capacities of the parties, their age and health, their
standard of living, and their financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage. Here, the
appellant has spent substantial time during the pendency of the litigation without the emotional or
financial support of the respondent. Moreover, granting a lumpsum as permanent alimony ensures
finality and reduces the scope for future litigation between the parties. While the appellant is
presumably capable of earning, she has undoubtedly faced financial and emotional setbacks due to
the prolonged litigation and separation. Similarly, the financial provision for the daughter ensures
her welfare is not compromised due to the breakdown of the marital relationship between her
parents.

40. For the reasons stated above, this Court directs the respondent husband to pay a sum of Rs.
50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) to the appellant as permanent alimony and an additional Rs.
50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty lakhs only) to their daughter for her education and future expenses, such
as her marriage. These payments shall be made within four months from the date of this judgment.
41. Consequently, the appeal is dismissed, the decree of divorce is upheld, and the maintenance
amount above granted is (2021)2 SCC 324 directed to be paid by the respondent to the appellant
and their daughter within the time specified above.
42. There shall be no order(s) as to costs.
