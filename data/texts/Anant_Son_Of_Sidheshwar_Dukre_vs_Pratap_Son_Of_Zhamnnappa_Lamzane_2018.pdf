Court   of   Judicature   at Bombay   (Aurangabad   Bench)   in   a   claim   under   the   Motor
Vehicles Act. 
3. The facts giving rise to the present petition briefly stated are as follows:
3.1. The Appellant herein is the Claimant, who was 29 year old   at   the   time   of   the
  accident,   and   employed   as   a driver, drawing a monthly salary of Rs. 8,500.

were travelling by motorcycle from  Pune towards   Tambewasi,   when   a   Maruti   Car   bearing
Registration No. MH−14/AE 1108 owned and driven by Respondent   No.   1   collided   with   them.  
The   car   was coming from the wrong side of the road, and was trying to   overtake   a   State  
Transport   Bus,   when   it   hit   the Appellant’s motor cycle.
T h e  A p p e l l a n t  f e l l  o n  t h e  r o a d  a n d  s u s t a i n e d  m u l t i p l e

resulted   in Permanent Disability to the extent of 75% for which a Disability 
Certificate was submitted before the MACT. Appellant also filed an Injury Certificate which records
the various injuries suffered by him.  3.2. With   respect   to   the   injuries   sustained   by   the   wife,
  a separate Claim Petition was filed before the MACT. The present   Appeal   pertains   only   to   the

3.4. The MACT vide Order dt. 07.02.2015 partly allowed the Claim   Petition   and   granted   Rs.  
7,00,000   as   a   lump− sum   compensation   payable   jointly   and   severally   by both   the

departure   from   the multiplier method, and granted a lump−sum amount as compensation.   The  
Tribunal   did   not   grant compensation under various heads such as actual loss

the   present   Appellant   filed First Appeal u/S. 173 of the M.V. Act for enhancement of  
compensation,   before   the   High   Court.   The   High Court   vide   its   Judgment   dated  
25.01.2017   partly allowed the Appeal by enhancing the compensation to Rs.   14,65,500  with  9% 
Interest  p.a. from   the  date  of application,   till   realization.   The   High   Court   held   that lump−

4.1. Both the Courts below have found from the evidence, that   the   Respondent   was
  driving   his   car   rashly   and negligently.
4.2. The   Appellant,   who   was   a   young   29   year   old   on   the date   of   the

 Appellant  was  hospitalized from   25.10.2010   to   09.11.2010,   and   again   from
25.11.2010   to   05.12.2010.   The   Appellant   had sustained   multiple   injuries  
which   resulted   in Permanent   Disability   to   the   extent   of   75%   which   is
evidenced from the Disability Certificate issued by his Doctor.   On   account   of   the  
Permanent   Disability,   the Appellant is not able to drive any motor vehicle.  4.3.

General Manager in Fiat India Automobiles Ltd. from June,   2008,   and   was   the   head   of   the  
Engine Department.   He   further   deposed   that   the   Appellant was   employed   by   him,   and  
was   driving   his   personal car from 01.08.2008 on a monthly salary of Rs. 8,500.
He also gave a certificate to that effect.  The High Court erroneously concluded that it would
be just and appropriate if the monthly income of the Appellant   is   considered   at   Rs.   5,000   on  
the   ground that   the   salary   of   Rs.   8500   for   a   driver   was   on   the higher side. 
We   do   not   agree   with   the   reasoning   given   by   the High   Court   for   not   accepting   the  
income   of   the Appellant. The income of the Appellant must be taken as Rs. 8500 per month.

The Claimant is entitled to be compensated for his inability   to   lead   a   full   life,   and   enjoy  
those   things   and amenities which he would have enjoyed, but for the injuries.
6.  The purpose of compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act is   to   fully   and   adequately  
restore   the   aggrieved   to   the position prior to the accident. 
This Court in Yadav Kumar v. The Divisional Manager, National   Insurance   Company   Ltd.1 
explained   “just compensation” in the following words:
“ I t  g o e s  w i t h o u t  s a y i n g  t h a t  i n  m a t t e r s  o f  d e t e r m i n a t i o n
o f  c o m p e n s a t i o n  b o t h  t h e  T r i b u n a l  a n d  t h e  C o u r t  a r e
s t a t u t o r i l y  c h a r g e d  w i t h  a  r e s p o n s i b i l i t y  o f  f i x i n g  a  ‘ j u s t
compensation’. It is obviously true that determination of   a   just   compensation  
cannot   be   equated   to   a bonanza.   At   the   same   time   the   concept   of   ‘just
c o m p e n s a t i o n ’    o b v i o u s l y    s u g g e s t s    a p p l i c a t i o n    o f    f a i r
and equitable principles and a reasonable approach on the   part   of   the   Tribunals  
and   Courts.   This reasonableness on the part of the Tribunal and Court
must be on a large peripheral field.”
7.  The Appellant would be entitled to compensation as follows:
7 . 1 .  T h e  A p p e l l a n t ’ s  i n c o m e  w a s  R s .  8 , 5 0 0  p e r  m o n t h .  T h e
Appellant was 29 year at the time of the accident. The Multiplier laid down in
 Sarla Verma and Ors. v. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors.2 would be 17.  7.2.

a   result   of   injuries,   the 1 ( 2010 ) 10 SCC 341 2  (2009) 6 SCC 121

income, it has to be quantified in terms of money, to arrive   at   the   future   loss   of  
earnings   suffered   by   the claimant.   Hence,   the   compensation   to   be   awarded  
is calculated as follows:
i. Minimum   annual   income   of   Appellant   = 8,500 x 12 = Rs. 1,02,000 ii.
Loss of future income at the level of his disability (i.e. 75%) = 75% of 1,02,000 =
R s .  7 6 , 5 0 0  p . a .   i i i .  M u l t i p l i e r  a p p l i c a b l e  ( 2 9  y e a r s )  =  1 7  i v .
L o s s  o f  f u t u r e  e a r n i n g s  =  7 6 , 5 0 0  x  1 7  =  R s .  1 3 , 0 0 , 5 0 0  7 . 3 .
T h e  A p p e l l a n t  h a s  c l a i m e d  c o m p e n s a t i o n  f o r  a c t u a l  l o s s
of income at Rs. 1,50,000. This claim of the Appellant cannot   succeed.   The   grant  
of   loss   of   future   income compensates   for   any   further   period   of   time   where
income   was   lost.   Actual   loss   of   income   can   only   be awarded   for   the  
m o n t h    i n    w h i c h    t h e    a c c i d e n t    t o o k

awarded for the month of October.  7.4. The   Appellant   has   claimed  
reimbursement   of   Medical Expenses at Rs. 2,50,000. 
The MACT in para 4 of the judgment recorded that the   Claimant   had   incurred   total  
expenditure   of   Rs. 5,50,000   till   the   date   of   the   judgment   for   medicines, hospital  
charges,   doctor’s   fee,   operation   charges, travelling   expenses   and   expense   for   special   diet  
and granted Rs. 2,00,000 as compensation based on actual expenditure. 
Since the Appellant has claimed expenses for special diet   and   attendance   charges   separately  
before   this Court, we find it appropriate to award Rs. 2,50,000 as claimed   by   him   on   account  
of   recurring   medical expenses.

the   injury suffered, the Appellant has permanently lost the source of   livelihood   as   his  
movement   has   got   severely restricted with permanent impairment of the right side of   his   body.
  As   he   is   permanently   disabled   for   life, towards   the   attendance   and   conveyance   charges

on this account. This amount seems to be meager to this   Court   given   inflationary   trends,   and  
increased costs of living. 
In  Puttamma   and   Ors.   v.   K.L.   Narayana   Reddy and Anr.4 this Court has stated:
“...   we   hold   that   the   Second   Schedule   as   was enacted   in   1994   has   now  
become   redundant, irrational   and   unworkable   due   to   changed
scenario including the present cost of living and current   rate   of   inflation   and  
increased   life expectancy.” 4 (2013) 15 SCC 45 In   view   of   the   said   principle,  
compensation   for special diet and nutrition be enhanced to Rs. 80,000. 7.7.
