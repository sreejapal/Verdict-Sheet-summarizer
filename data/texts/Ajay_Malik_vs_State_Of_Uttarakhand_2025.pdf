Leave granted.
2. The instant appeals arise out of the common First Information Report No. 60/2017 (Case Crime
No. 94/2017) (FIR), which inter alia contains allegations of wrongful confinement and trafficking of
a female domestic worker—the Complainant.

3. To further clarify, SLP (Crl.) No. 8777/2022, has been preferred by the accused Ajay Malik in the
FIR, as against the judgment dated 01.09.2022 of the High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital (High
Court), whereby Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 96 of 2018 (CMA), seeking the
compounding and quashing of the criminal proceedings initiated against him, was rejected (Ajay
Malik’s case). SLP (Crl.) No. 15131/2024, on the other hand, has been filed by the State of
Uttarakhand, challenging the judgment dated 12.01.2021, in Criminal Revision No. 173 of 2019,
whereby the co-accused Ashok Kumar’s Revision Application seeking discharge was allowed by the
High Court (Ashok Kumar’s case).
A. FACTS
4. Considering that these appeals arise from the same incident, their factual matrices remain
predominantly uniform, with differences largely being restricted to the differing roles ascribed to
Ajay Malik and Ashok Kumar. It is thus necessary to briefly advert to the facts that lay the
foundation for these appeals.
A. 1 Background to the materialization of the criminal incident 4.1 The Complainant, a resident of
Birhipani Nawatoli Bokhi, Birhipani, District Jashpur, Chhattisgarh, belongs to a financially
disadvantaged family from a Scheduled Tribe. In her search for employment to support her family,
she was brought to Delhi in 2009 by her neighbours, Subhash and Mohan Ram, under the pretext of
securing work.
2|Page 4.2 Upon her arrival in Delhi, the Complainant was handed over to one Shambhu @ Sambhu
Prasad, who reportedly operated an office at Britannia Chowk, Shakurpur, Delhi. Shambhu claimed
to run the Saint Maryam Placement Services (Regd.), ostensibly showcased as a social welfare
society for Scheduled Tribes (Placement Agency). Shambhu forcibly deployed the Complainant as a
domestic help/housekeeper in various households, requiring her to perform tasks such as washing
utensils and cleaning. As a result, she was reportedly sent to multiple locations, including Karnal,
Delhi, Gurgaon, and Kanpur. The Complainant further alleged in the FIR that Shambhu through the
Placement Agency failed to compensate her for the labour extracted, and instead misappropriated
her earnings. In this regard, the Complainant also alleged that she was routinely assaulted whenever
she requested remuneration or sought permission to return home. 4.3 Ajay Malik recruited the
Complainant on 16.10.2016, having purportedly entered into a written agreement with the
Placement Agency, for her to work as a domestic help at his official residence. Subsequently, two
individuals employed by Shambhu dropped off the Complainant at Ajay Malik’s home in Dehradun,
Uttarakhand. Ajay Malik at the time was serving as a Scientist at the Defence Electronics
Application Laboratory, Defence Research and Development Organization under the Ministry of
Defence (DRDO), where he had been employed since 1988. As a Class-I Officer, Ajay Malik had been
allotted a Type-V Government accommodation, where he resided with his wife
3|Page and two children. The alleged incident is said to have occurred on these premises.
4.4 Ajay Malik, on 22.03.2017, departed from his residence with his entire family, for official duty
concerning the SDR-AR Phase II L Band Trials at Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd., Kanpur. During the

absence of Ajay Malik and his family, the Complainant was left behind on the premises, the main
entry to which had been locked. A spare key to the home had been entrusted to his friend and
neighbour, Ashok Kumar, who is alleged to have visited Ajay Malik’s residence regularly to provide
the Complainant with drinking water and to keep watch on her. The Complainant has further stated
in the FIR that Ajay Malik had also left a mobile phone with the Complainant to remain in regular
touch with her, using which she was able to contact the Police Authorities on 29.03.2017, to register
a complaint of wrongful confinement. A. 2 Registration of the FIR 4.5 Acting on the Complainant’s
information, the Police arrived at Ajay Malik’s residence, and with the assistance of Ashok Kumar,
entered the premises. The Complainant was subsequently recovered, and the Police prepared a
Recovery Memo dated 29.03.2017. Following this, an FIR was lodged on 30.03.2017 against four
individuals—Ajay Malik, Mohan Ram, Subhash, and Shambhu—under Sections 343 and 370 of the
Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC), at Police Station Rampur, District Sadar, Dehradun. On the same
day, the Complainant’s statement was
4|Page recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC), before the
Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Dehradun. 4.6 The investigation commenced, during which the
Investigating Officer recorded witness statements, collected evidence, and subsequently filed the
first Chargesheet against Shambhu on 09.07.2017. A second Chargesheet was filed on 31.12.2017
against the remaining three co- accused, whereby Ajay Malik specifically was accused of having
committed offences under Sections 343 and 370 read with Section 120B of the IPC. Finally, the third
Chargesheet came to be filed on 22.12.2017 against Ashok Kumar, who had not been named in the
FIR or the initial complaint, charging him under Sections 343 and 120B of the IPC.
A. 3 Commencement of criminal proceedings 4.7 It is at this juncture that the criminal proceedings
against Ajay Malik and Ashok Kumar commenced separately and may be traversed as such.
A. 3. 1 Ajay Malik’s case 4.8 Having been Chargesheeted in Case Crime No. 94/2017, Ajay Malik filed
CMA No. 96/2018 under Section 482 of the CrPC before the High Court in January, 2018, seeking
the quashing and setting aside of the:
(i) criminal proceedings initiated against him through the FIR; (ii) the Chargesheet
dated 31.10.2017; and (iii) the summoning order, passed in Criminal Case No.
5282/2017, pending before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Dehradun. The High Court
initially vide order dated
5|Page 25.01.2018, stayed the trial proceedings in the above-mentioned Criminal
Application.
4.9 Subsequently, Ajay Malik on 01.08.2022 moved Compounding Application No. 532/2022 before
the High Court seeking compounding of the alleged offences under Section 320 of the CrPC. The
application was supported by an affidavit affirmed by the Complainant herself, wherein she
provided that the parties had amicably settled the dispute. She further deposed that she had no
objection, should the offences against Ajay Malik be compounded and the criminal proceedings
against him be quashed.

4.10 That being so, the High Court vide the Impugned Judgment dated 01.09.2022, firstly rejected
Ajay Malik’s compounding application— observing that a prima facie case under Section 370 of the
IPC was made out against him, which is a non-compoundable offence under the aegis of Section 320
of the CrPC. Secondly, the High Court also deemed it fit to turn down Ajay Malik's main application
under Section 482 of the CrPC on merits, holding that the Chargesheet and witness testimonies
combined made out prima facie allegations of wrongful confinement against him.
4.11 As a sequel thereto, Ajay Malik has approached this Court. While issuing notice in Ajay Malik’s
case on 26.09.2022, this Court passed an ex-parte interim order staying his arrest in connection
with the captioned FIR, which operates till date.
6|Page A. 3. 2 Ashok Kumar’s case 4.12 Having elucidated the contextual backdrop amid which Ajay
Malik’s appeal arose, we now advert to the facts in Ashok Kumar’s case. We note, at the cost of
repetition, that the State of Uttarakhand has preferred this appeal against the order of the High
Court discharging him from the criminal proceedings in Sessions Trial No. 124/2018. 4.13 In this
scenario, the Police Authorities, having conducted further investigation in connection with the
captioned FIR and accompanying complaint, filed Third Charge Sheet No. 93B/2017 against Ashok
Kumar under Sections 343 and 120B of the IPC on 22.12.2017. The Magistrate, Dehradun, took
cognizance of the same on 31.01.2018. Aggrieved, Ashok Kumar preferred a Discharge Application
before the Court of First Additional Sessions Judge, Dehradun, under Section 227 of the CrPC on
06.08.2018. However, the said Court, vide order dated 02.03.2019, rejected his Discharge
Application, having found prima facie evidence that he had held the keys to the residence wherein
the Complainant was wrongfully confined.
4.14 Discontented with the order of the Sessions Court, Ashok Kumar moved the High Court
through Criminal Revision No. 173/2019, which has been allowed vide the Impugned Judgment
dated 12.01.2021, quashing the criminal proceedings emanating from the FIR qua him. While doing
so, the High Court stressed on the absence of any specific allegations against him in the FIR and
subsequent recorded statements. More pertinently, the High Court has also found that Ajay
7|Page Malik’s residence had two entry/exit points, with only one being locked—thereby
establishing that the Complainant had the option of egress available to her at all relevant times.
4.15 Consequently, the Second Additional District Judge, Dehradun, vide order dated 06.02.2021,
dropped the criminal proceedings against Ashok Kumar in Sessions Trial No. 124/2018. It is in this
factual backdrop that the aggrieved State is before us in appeal. B. CONTENTIONS
5. Before we formulate the issues that arise for consideration in these appeals, we may briefly note
the contentions forwarded by the parties:
5.1 Mr R. Basant, Learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of Ajay Malik, while
praying that the Impugned Judgment be set aside and the criminal proceedings
pending against him be quashed, submitted as follows:
Ajay Malik vs State Of Uttarakhand on 29 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79728784/
4
a) The Complainant’s statement under Section 164 of the CrPC indicates that she
merely requested Ajay Malik if she could leave his residence, and he responded by
requesting her to remain until alternative arrangements could be made. No evidence
of active wrongful restraint, as is contemplated under Section 343 of the IPC, is thus
presented.
b) A no-objection affidavit filed by the Complainant explicitly denies any confinement
or mistreatment by Ajay Malik, indicating a lack of grievance against him. This
affidavit should hold significant
8|Page weight, allowing the Court to quash proceedings, following the principles
evolved in Gian Singh v. State of Punjab 1 and Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab.2
c) The interim relief granted by the High Court demonstrates judicial recognition of
Ajay Malik’s case. In fact, decisions such as State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal,3 and
Rajiv Thapar v. Madan Lal Kapoor,4 emphasise the quashing of frivolous or baseless
prosecution.
d) The Complainant’s allegations are linked to prior disputes with the Placement
Agency, and not Ajay Malik, further diminishing the relevance of the charges
registered against him.
5.2 Mr Prashant Bhushan, Learned Counsel, appearing for Ashok Kumar, adopted the relevant part
of the contentions put forth on Ajay Malik’s behalf and fervently advocated to the correctness of the
Impugned Judgment in discharging Ashok Kumar. Additionally, he canvassed the following
submissions:
a) Ashok Kumar is not only a DRDO Officer with decades of unblemished service; he
also does not have any criminal antecedents. The only role attributable to Ashok
Kumar in this entire factual scenario is the key he possessed to Ajay Malik’s 1 Gian
Singh v. State of Punjab, 2012 (10) SCC 303. 2 Narinder Singh v. State of Punjab,
2014 INSC 217. 3 State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal, 1990 SCR Supl. (3) 259. 4 Rajiv
Thapar v. Madan Lal Kapoor, 2013 (3) SCC 330.
9|Page residence, which had been provided to him so that he could keep an eye on the premises in
the absence of the latter.
b) Ashok Kumar is being needlessly harassed for innocently and innocuously agreeing to keep the
aforementioned keys with him. He was completely unaware of any alleged wrongful confinement
being perpetrated by Ajay Malik. He, moreover, never went to Ajay Malik’s residence before the
police arrived.
c) Ashok Kumar is also not named in the FIR or the Complainant’s statement under Section 164 of
the CrPC. The Police have mechanically filed a Supplementary Chargesheet, roping him in as an

5
accused. In any case, the ingredients for the offences alleged against him have not been fulfilled.
5.3 Per contra, Ms Anubha Dhulia, Learned Standing Counsel for the State of Uttarakhand, sought
to not only defend the correctness of the High Court in disallowing Ajay Malik’s quashing
application but also vehemently opposed the discharge of Ashok Kumar. She, accordingly, advanced
the following contentions:
i. Ajay Malik’s case
a) The Complainant’s FIR details allegations of being locked in a house for a week,
with the key handed over to Ajay Malik’s associate. Moreover, her statements under
Sections 161 and 164 of the CrPC corroborate these claims, describing the
Complainant's inability to leave the premises and her limited 10 | P a g e access to
communication. Additionally, the Recovery Memo records the discovery of the
Complainant confined in a locked flat by Police Authorities and a video documenting
her release. Taken together, these facts clearly make out the charge of wrongful
confinement against Ajay Malik.
b) The victim belongs to a Below Poverty Line-Scheduled Tribe family, which highlights the power
imbalance between the Complainant and Ajay Malik. This disparity raises serious concerns about
systemic exploitation, with legislative intent ensuring these offences remain non-compoundable
under Section 370 of the IPC.
c) The no-objection affidavit relied upon by Ajay Malik and allegedly affirmed by the Complainant is
a mere reproduction of the former’s Special Leave Petition before this Court. It thereby lacks
credibility, given the Complainant’s vulnerable status; and potential coercion or manipulation
cannot be ruled out at this stage.
d) Lastly, upholding these charges aligns with social and moral principles, ensuring accountability
for exploitation and addressing broader societal inequalities. Domestic workers, who often start
working when they are underage, are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by the elite classes—and
most such cases are never reported.
11 | P a g e ii. Ashok Kumar’s case
a) The Complainant’s FIR mentioned Ashok Kumar by name— credited as Ajay Malik’s friend—who
was responsible for looking after the Complainant and the premises in Ajay Malik’s absence.
Similarly, her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC also details the allegations against Ashok
Kumar. The High Court was thus incorrect in holding that no case was made out against him since
he was not named in these two documents.
b) The Recovery Memo further sheds light as to how when the Complainant was statedly freed from
Ajay Malik’s residence by Police Authorities, Ashok Kumar was called to the said premises, having
been in possession of the keys thereof. This fact speaks to the reality that the Complainant was

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79728784/
6
wrongfully confined in the house, with the sole key resting with Ashok Kumar, who while being
aware of the Complainant's confinement, nonetheless elected to let her remain in that position.
C. ISSUES
6. We have duly considered the rival submissions of the parties, as elucidated hereinabove, and
carefully perused the material on record. We find that the following issues need to be analysed:
i. Whether the High Court acted well within the contours of its powers under Section
482 of the CrPC in rejecting Ajay Malik’s quashing petition?
12 | P a g e ii. Whether the High Court fell in error in rejecting the Compounding
Application moved by Ajay Malik and supported by the Complainant?
iii. Whether the High Court was legally correct in accepting Ashok Kumar’s Criminal Revision,
thereby discharging him from the captioned criminal proceedings?
iv. Whether the existing legal framework in India sufficiently protects the rights of domestic
workers?
D. ANALYSIS
7. It may be noted at the outset that while evaluating the issues formulated above, we have taken
into consideration the credentials of both, Ajay Malik and Ashok Kumar; the contents of the FIR;
the Complainant’s statements; and her affidavits filed before the High Court and this Court.
D. 1 Issue No. 1: The correctness of rejecting Ajay Malik’s quashing application
8. It is well established that a High Court, in exercising its extraordinary powers under Section 482
of the CrPC, may issue orders to prevent the abuse of court processes or to secure the ends of justice.
These inherent powers are neither controlled nor limited by any other statutory provision. However,
given the broad and profound nature of this authority, the High Court must exercise it sparingly.
The conditions for invoking such powers are embedded within Section 482 13 | P a g e of the CrPC
itself, allowing the High Court to act only in cases of clear abuse of process or where intervention is
essential to uphold the ends of justice.
9. It is in this backdrop that this Court, over the course of several decades, has laid down the
principles and guidelines that High Courts must follow before quashing criminal proceedings at the
threshold; thereby pre-empting the Prosecution from building its case before the Trial Court. The
grounds for quashing, inter alia, contemplate the following situations: (i) the criminal complaint has
been filed with mala fides; (ii) the FIR represents an abuse of the legal process; (iii) no prima facie
offence is made out; (iv) the dispute is civil in nature; (v) the complaint contains vague and omnibus
allegations; and (vi) the parties are willing to settle and compound the dispute amicably.5

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79728784/
7
10. Turning to the facts of the present case, it is thus necessary to examine each of the offences
alleged against Ajay Malik to determine whether a prima facie case has been established and if there
is any justification for quashing the criminal proceedings against him. D. 1. 1 The offences alleged
against Ajay Malik
11. The analysis in this regard will address each of the offences enumerated against Ajay Malik,
namely: (i) wrongful confinement under Section 343 of the IPC; (ii) human trafficking under Section
370 of the IPC; and (iii) criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of the IPC. 5 State of Haryana v.
Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335.
14 | P a g e D.1.1.1 Wrongful confinement under Section 343 of the IPC
12. The IPC defines ‘wrongful confinement’ as ‘wrongfully restraining any person in such a manner
so as to prevent that person from proceeding beyond certain circumscribing limits’. Put more
simply, this offence requires the satisfaction of two prongs: (i) the voluntary restraint of any person;
and (ii) the act being done in a manner such that it prevents the said person from proceeding
beyond circumscribing limits.
13. The State of Uttarakhand in this regard has vehemently contended that there are several factors
militating against Ajay Malik, including the FIR detailing that he allegedly wrongfully confined the
Complainant at his residence, and the Recovery Memo which enumerates that the Complainant was
locked inside Ajay Malik’s residence, with the main gate being doubly locked. The specific allegation
thus seems to be that Ajay Malik restricted the Complainant’s movements from the circumscribed
limit of his residence.
14. While this assertion appears plausible, what raises concern for this Court is the claim that an
alternative exit was available to the Complainant, allowing her to freely enter and exit the premises.
This fact is fortified by the High Court's findings in the Impugned Judgment in Ashok Kumar's case,
which held that:
“7. The learned Magistrate did not consider the aspect of the matter that where the
complainant was resided in the house of Ajay Malik which has two entries, one entry
the lock was put and another entry was free. Upon consideration of the case record
and the document
15 | P a g e submitted therewith there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused. The
revisionist was liable to be discharged under Section 227 of Cr.P.C., which is quoted hereunder:-
“227. Discharge- If, upon consideration of the record of the case and the documents
submitted therewith, and after hearing the submissions of the accused and the
prosecution on this behalf, the Judge considers that there is not sufficient ground for
proceeding against the accused, he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons
for so doing.” [Emphasis Supplied]
Ajay Malik vs State Of Uttarakhand on 29 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79728784/
8
15. This factual finding aligns with Ajay Malik's consistent assertion that, although
the main entry to his residence was locked, an alternative exit remained accessible for
the Complainant to use, which has also been illustrated in the site plan of the subject
premises. Furthermore, even as far as the Recovery Memo is concerned, it seems that
the Police did not inspect or document the existence of this alternate exit, leaving its
availability unverified.
16. Be that as it may, certain additional factual circumstances lend further support to
this conclusion. First, the mobile phone allegedly left by Ajay Malik with the
Complainant, and subsequently recovered by the police, raises questions about the
plausibility of wrongful confinement. It remains unexplained why Ajay Malik would
provide the Complainant with a means of communication, allowing her to contact
others at will, had he intended to confine her or restrict her within circumscribed
limits. Second, the Complainant had been issued a temporary pass issued by the
DRDO Colony, where Ajay Malik’s residence is located.
The existence of this pass bolsters Ajay Malik's claim that the Complainant frequently left the
residence and the colony for errands.
16 | P a g e Third, the Complainant’s own no-objection affidavits, explicitly state that she was never
wrongfully confined and that an alternative exit was always accessible to her.
17. On an objective consideration of this uncontroverted material on record, there can be no other
conclusion except to hold that the allegations, even if accepted to be true, do not disclose the
commission of an offence by Ajay Malik under Section 343 of the IPC. D.1.1.2 Trafficking and
exploitation under Section 370 of the IPC
18. We now turn to the allegations against Ajay Malik under Section 370 of the IPC, pertaining to the
trafficking and exploitation of the Complainant. In this regard, taking into consideration the
extenuating circumstances surrounding this case, this allegation seems to lack any substantial merit.
We say so for the following reasons:
i. The FIR includes allegations of assault and exploitation against Ajay Malik and the
other co-accused. However, a closer examination reveals that the bulk of the FIR
primarily focuses on two neighbours, Subhash and Mohan Ram, who allegedly
brought the Complainant to Delhi, and Shambhu, who is accused of persistently
harassing the Complainant and exploiting her vulnerable situation.
ii. In the Complainant's statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC, the
allegations against Ajay Malik seemingly diminish. She instead provides a detailed
account of how her neighbours brought 17 | P a g e her to Delhi and handed her over
to Shambhu, who subsequently sent her to work in various cities, withheld her
rightful earnings, and consistently denied her requests to return home. In contrast,
the only mention of Ajay Malik in her statement pertains to his alleged refusal to send
Ajay Malik vs State Of Uttarakhand on 29 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79728784/
9
her home until alternative arrangements were made and his having allegedly locked
her in a room. The Complainant also notes that Ajay Malik had left a mobile phone
with her before leaving for Delhi and maintained regular contact with her during that
time.
iii. The no-objection affidavit submitted by the Complainant before the High Court as part of Ajay
Malik’s Compounding Application, elucidates that the Complainant has no grievances against Ajay
Malik and unequivocally asserts that she was neither trafficked nor wrongfully confined by him. She
further expresses her willingness to have all pending criminal proceedings against Ajay Malik
quashed. At the High Court's request, the Complainant appeared virtually and reiterated her
categorical stance, confirming that she holds no complaints against Ajay Malik. The relevant
paragraph from the Impugned Judgment in this case reads as follows:
“10. After having interacted with the complainant/respondent No. 2 herein through video
conferencing, she had submitted that the present applicant is not responsible for the act, which was
complained of by her and which finds reference in her statement too, which was recorded under
Section 164 of Cr.PC.” [Emphasis Supplied] 18 | P a g e
19. Furthermore, during the pendency of these proceedings, the Complainant filed an additional
affidavit before this Court as well, which carries significant weight and warrants our undivided
attention. In this affidavit, she reiterates that she was never wrongfully confined or trafficked by
Ajay Malik and affirms that she was always treated with dignity and respect. She further states that
she is now happily married with a daughter and has no desire to prolong the embarrassment caused
to Ajay Malik and his family due to the allegations. It is thus abundantly clear that the Complainant
has sought to recant the entirety of her allegations against Ajay Malik.
20. In this vein, having duly and holistically considered all of these aspects in toto, we are of the
opinion that no prima facie offence under Section 370 of the IPC qua Ajay Malik has been made out
as well. Not only is there no evidence of neglect or exploitation of the Complainant by Ajay Malik on
record, but her own sworn statements in denying any abuse must also be given due credence.
21. We deem it important to note that while there may have been instances suggesting some degree
of labour-based exploitation of the Complainant by Ajay Malik and his family, this is not evident
from the face of the record, and we are not inclined to initiate an inquiry into this aspect. In any
event, such allegations do not constitute an offense under Section 370 of the IPC, and we cannot
conclusively find Ajay Malik guilty of trafficking and exploitation as defined therein. However, that
being said, this case has prompted us to frame Issue No. IV, 19 | P a g e whereby we have elaborately
addressed the pressing need to establish guidelines to safeguard the rights of domestic workers
employed in households across the country.
D.1.1.3 Criminal conspiracy under Section 120B of the IPC
22. Finally, we turn to the allegations against Ajay Malik under Section 120B of the IPC, which deals
with punishment for criminal conspiracy. It is trite law that the principal ingredient of this offence is
Ajay Malik vs State Of Uttarakhand on 29 January, 2025

the agreement to commit an offence.6 The charge of conspiracy must be explicitly evidenced, and
should be easily discernable in the acts of the conspiring parties. This Court has also previously held,
in no uncertain terms, that conspiracy cannot be made out without some kind of physical
manifestation of the alleged agreement being established.7
23. As previously noted, Ajay Malik employed the Complainant through the Placement Agency
established by Shambhu for domestic work at his residence in Dehradun, which she joined on
16.10.2016. She continued to work there for over five months without any untoward incident. As per
the purported agreement between the Placement Agency and Ajay Malik, the Complainant’s wages
were regularly paid to her through the Agency. It therefore appears that the only agreement between
Ajay Malik and co-accused Shambhu was the employment of the Complainant as domestic help at
the former’s residence. 6 State of Kerala v. P. Sugathan and Anr., (2000) 8 SCC 203. 7 Ram Narayan
Popli v. CBI, (2003) 3 SCC 641.
20 | P a g e
24. Furthermore, a thorough review of the material on record does not indicate any orchestrated
arrangement by Ajay Malik with the co- accused to exploit or confine the Complainant. On the
contrary, the case appears to involve minimal interaction or communication between Ajay Malik
and the co-accused. Any correspondence between them seems limited strictly to hiring of the
Complainant as a domestic worker at Ajay Malik’s residence. Against this backdrop, the charge
under Section 120B of the IPC qua Ajay Malik is highly speculative and warrants rejection at the
very threshold.
D. 1. 2 Whether quashing would be justified?
25. In light of the conclusions reached regarding each of the offences alleged against Ajay Malik, it
becomes clear that the Investigating Agency has failed to establish any prima facie case. Since the
FIR has been investigated and a Chargesheet has been filed, the FIR alone cannot serve as the basis
for dismissing Ajay Malik’s claims.
26. Even assuming the FIR is accurate, it does not substantiate the charges, which appear to have
been mechanically transcribed into the Chargesheet, despite the Investigating Agency having had
sufficient opportunity to gather material evidence. Notably, no element of illegal confinement,
trafficking, or criminal conspiracy has been established against Ajay Malik. Additionally, the
Complainant has, under oath, stated that she was not illegally confined. If this remains her position
in Court, the purpose of proceeding to trial becomes questionable, 21 | P a g e amounting to an
exercise in futility and a sheer wastage of judicial resources.
27. Based on the foregoing facts, it appears that the Complainant’s primary grievance lies in the
unfair treatment she received from Subhash, Mohan Ram, and Shambhu. At this juncture, it is
important to note that the allegations against these three co-accused are significantly more serious
and grave, considering that charges have been filed against them under Sections 370, 373 and 376 of
the IPC. The Placement Agency run by Shambhu could be described as a deceptive front, supposedly

11
aimed at the welfare of tribal girls, but in reality, it perpetuates their abuse and exploitation. This
dubious operation seems to be the root cause of the Complainant’s suffering, with Ajay Malik having
been included in the FIR without substantial justification.
28. In this backdrop, it appears to us that the Complainant's actions were driven by a fear that
should she leave Ajay Malik's employment, as she had done in previous jobs in different cities, she
would once again fall under the control of the Placement Agency, which would subject her to further
exploitation and abuse. This fear likely led her to lodge the complaint as a means of escaping her
situation. This sequence of events aligns with the Complainant's subsequent and consistent stance
thereafter, in which she asserts that Ajay Malik and his family did not wrongfully confine or exploit
her. Furthermore, she has expressed a desire for the proceedings against Ajay Malik, who is a retired
senior citizen now, to be quashed.
22 | P a g e
29. In light of the absence of any prima facie evidence of wrongdoing by Ajay Malik; the vague and
omnibus claims made in the FIR and subsequently the Chargesheet; and the Complainant's
consistent stance to compound and settle the dispute, we are unable to concur with the High Court's
conclusion in the Impugned Judgement, which otherwise constitutes a fit case for quashing.
D.2 Issue No. 2: The correctness of rejecting Ajay Malik’s Compounding Application
30. We now turn to the second issue in Ajay Malik’s case concerning the rejection of his
compounding application. As stated previously, Ajay Malik had moved a Compounding Application
in his pending petition, based on the strength of the Complainant’s no-objection affidavit.
31. Section 320 of the CrPC provides for the compounding of offences, and its appended Schedule
lists the various criminal offences that may be compounded or settled by and between the parties
under the Court's supervision. In the facts of the instant case, the FIR against Ajay Malik was
registered under Sections 343 and 370 of the IPC. Incontrovertibly, Section 370 IPC, being a serious
offence, does not find a place on the Schedule attached to Section 320 of the CrPC and is thus
classified as a non-compoundable offence.
32. Although we are inclined to agree with the High Court’s rejection of Ajay Malik’s Compounding
Application owing to the non-compoundable nature of alleged offences, this issue is nonetheless
rendered academic given our conclusion in the previous issue, where we have rejected the 23 | P a g
e High Court’s view regarding Ajay Malik’s quashing application.
Therefore, while we may not need to delve into this issue, it must be underscored that a delicate
balance ought to be struck in cases wherein the parties seek compounding of the offences. Though
well- intentioned, an excessively moralistic order may unnecessarily prolong criminal proceedings,
which have no logical conclusion and only serve to further distress the parties. Accordingly, the
correctness of the High Court’s decision to disallow Ajay Malik’s Compounding Application does not
require our consideration on merits.

D. 3 Issue No. 3: The State’s challenge to Ashok Kumar’s discharge
33. Adverting to Ashok Kumar’s case, we shall now consider the merit of the State's challenge to the
Impugned Judgment therein. At the cost of repetition, the proceedings herein concern Ashok
Kumar, a neighbor and friend of Ajay Malik. Although Ashok Kumar was not initially named in the
FIR, he was later Chargesheeted by the Investigating Officer and included as a co-accused. The State
is aggrieved by the High Court’s decision to allow Ashok Kumar’s Criminal Revision Petition,
thereby discharging him from the criminal proceedings arising from the captioned FIR.
34. It is trite law that the discharge stage acts as a critical filter to eliminate cases lacking legal merit,
sparing the accused from unnecessary proceedings, while ensuring that credible cases proceed to
trial. Thus, discharge under Section 227 of the CrPC is justified when the material on record fails to
disclose a prima facie case against the accused to 24 | P a g e proceed for trial. The legislative spirit
behind this provision envisions the rights of the accused being balanced with public interest, so as to
ultimately prevent abuse of the legal process.
35. The sum of the allegations against Ashok Kumar is that he held the key to the residence where
the Complainant was allegedly wrongfully confined. While we have already negated the claims of
wrongful confinement against Ajay Malik based on the High Court's finding regarding the
alternative exit available to the Complainant, certain additional mitigating circumstances may be
observed in the case of Ashok Kumar. Firstly, there is no direct allegation against him made by the
Complainant herself. Neither the FIR nor the Complainant's statements disclose any explicit, illegal
act on Ashok Kumar's part. Secondly, Ashok Kumar was not named in the original FIR, and was
only added by way of a Supplementary Chargesheet by the Investigating Officer, seemingly as an
after-thought. This hasty inclusion lacks any substantive justification. Thirdly, while Ashok Kumar
was delivered the keys by Ajay Malik and held them as a favor to him, there is no evidence to suggest
that he ever visited the premises or was aware and acting in furtherance of any wrongful
confinement of the Complainant.
36. For these reasons, we have no hesitation in upholding the correctness of the reasoned order of
the High Court, in allowing the discharge of Ashok Kumar from the criminal proceedings. Given the
demonstrable lack of any mens rea or intent on the part of Ashok Kumar, apart from 25 | P a g e the
lack of any direct involvement, his discharge is well-founded and warrants no interference by this
Court.
D. 4 Issue No. 4: Domestic workers’ lacking legal protection in India
37. We lastly address the final issue framed by us in these appeals, which pertains to the rights,
protections, and privileges (or lack thereof) accorded to domestic workers in the Indian milieu.
While this broader issue may only be tangential to the present appeals, we have taken it upon
ourselves to deal with the same in light of the gravity and nature of the systemic issues we have been
presented with. D. 4. 1 Background
Ajay Malik vs State Of Uttarakhand on 29 January, 2025

38. It is an incontrovertible fact that the demand for domestic workers has been mounting in India,
in consonance with rapid urbanization and development. According to reports by the International
Labor Organization (ILO)—which is a United Nations agency devoted to promoting internationally
recognized labour and human rights— domestic workers currently constitute a significant portion of
the unorganised workforce in India,8 with millions of individuals, primarily women,9 engaged in
this sector. Their contributions are indispensable to urban households, performing tasks such as
cooking, cleaning, caregiving, and other essential services.
8 ILO Report, “Indispensable yet unprotected: Working conditions of Indian Domestic Workers at
Home and Abroad”, 2015.
9 ILO Report, “Employer practices and perceptions on paid domestic work: Recruitment,
employment relationships, and social protection”, 2023.
26 | P a g e
39. While any avenues for employment being opened to marginalised women merit celebration, we
are at pains to note that despite their growing demand, this indispensable workforce has also been
the most vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. Domestic workers often belong to marginalised
communities, such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, and
Economically Weaker Sections. They are compelled to undertake domestic work due to financial
hardship or displacement, further reinforcing their vulnerability. That is not to say, however, that
we are declaiming this source of gainful employment that is readily available to women across all
social sub- stratas. On the contrary, we seek to affirm this important livelihood that is available to so
many women, which brings them one step closer to financial security and the accompanying
independence.
40. Our concerns instead lie with the non-regulation of this crucial labour sector, which often leads
to the aforementioned malignant results. The same is abundantly evident from the factual
circumstances of the present appeals, wherein the Complainant was tortured and exploited for
several years at the hands of individuals who forcibly transported her to differing cities, in the
promise of a better life which never materialised. The purported Placement Agency which employed
the Complainant continually leeched her salaries, leaving her utterly destitute and helpless.
41. The simple reason for this harassment and rampant abuse, which seems to be prevalent
throughout the country, is the legal vacuum 27 | P a g e which exists vis-à-vis the rights and
protection of domestic workers. Indeed, domestic workers in India remain largely unprotected and
without any comprehensive legal recognition. As a result, they frequently endure low wages, unsafe
environments, and extended hours without effective recourse.
42. Before we discuss the Indian legal experience with domestic workers, it is perhaps fitting to
advert to the prevailing international standards. D. 4. 2 International norms and standards
Ajay Malik vs State Of Uttarakhand on 29 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79728784/
14
43. In the international spectrum, over the course of many decades, the ILO has provided various
guidelines and conventions for the betterment of labour laws across the world. It is noteworthy that
it has also extensively sought to protect the rights of domestic workers, which it recognises as a
uniquely disadvantaged and marginalised class. It proactively advocates for the inclusion of
domestic workers in pre- existing labour treaties. For instance, during discussions on the Protection
of Workers’ Claims (Employer’s Insolvency) Convention, 1992 (No. 173), the definition of
‘insolvency’ was revised to refer to as ‘employer’s assets’ instead of the narrower term ‘enterprise’s
assets,’ ensuring domestic workers were covered. Moreover, Article 2 of the Freedom of Association
and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87), applies to all ‘workers and
employers’ without any exception.
44. Reference may also be made to the principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunity in
the Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) 28 | P a g e Convention, 1958 (No. 111), and the
Equal Remuneration Convention, 1951 (No. 100), which also cover domestic workers. In fact, the
ILO Committee of Experts has repeatedly emphasised that laws or policies promoting equality in
jobs must include domestic workers and that excluding them would violate these Conventions.10
45. However, the most significant international development in the realm of the rights of domestic
workers was in 2011, with the adoption of the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189). This
Convention offers specific protection to domestic workers while laying down the basic rights that
such workers are entitled to, and the measures that States must take to ensure decent work
conditions. These protections include regulating work settings and providing domestic workers with
social security benefits that are at par with other workers. This Convention is supplemented by the
ILO Recommendation No. 201, which further addresses the need for facilities like proper
accommodation, food, and the medical health of domestic workers.
46. Apart from the illustrative treaties reproduced hereinabove, the plight of domestic workers is
also addressed in several other Conventions. For instance, the International Convention on the
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 1990, in its General
Comment No. 1, provides for and acknowledges the particularly vulnerable position of migrant
domestic workers. Similarly, General Comment No. 26 to the landmark Convention on the 10 ILO
Guide, “Effective Protection for Domestic Workers: A Guide to Designing Labour Laws”, 2012; ILO
Manual, “Achieving decent work for domestic works”, 2012.
29 | P a g e Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1979 addresses female
migrant workers and extends to those undertaking domestic work as well.
47. Thus, contemporary international standards not only acknowledge the vulnerability of domestic
workers but also strive to provide them extensive protection and parity with other labourers. D. 4. 3
Domestic laws and guidelines
48. Coming to the legal standing of domestic workers within India, there seems to be a degree of
lacunae in legislative frameworks, safeguarding and protecting their rights.

49. At this juncture, we must fairly note that there have already been several attempts to bring
domestic workers under legal protection. However, for a plethora of reasons that are beyond the
scope of the present discussion, these Bills have never materialized into tangible laws or policies. In
this regard, we may briefly note the following:
i. The Domestic Workers (Conditions of Employment) Bill of 1959 was among the
earliest legislative attempts to regulate the working conditions of domestic workers.
It aimed to establish minimum standards for wages, work hours, and employment
terms for domestic workers. However, the Bill received little support and was
ultimately not enacted into law. ii. The House Workers (Conditions of Service) Bill of
1989 sought to address similar issues, focusing on formalising employment 30 | P a g
e practices and providing essential safeguards for domestic workers.
Despite being introduced, this Bill neither formed the subject of significant Parliamentary
discussions nor advanced towards enactment.
iii. The Housemaids and Domestic Workers (Conditions of Service and Welfare) Bill, 2004 was
introduced in the Rajya Sabha as a private member’s Bill. This Bill proposed mandatory registration
of domestic workers and required the government to ensure sufficient employment opportunities,
medical benefits, and other welfare measures. It also included penalties for employers hiring
unregistered workers. However, the Bill was not passed by Parliament.
iv. The Domestic Workers (Registration, Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2008, introduced by the
National Commission for Women, aimed to establish a registration process for domestic workers
and to provide them with social security benefits. The Bill did not progress beyond its drafting stage
and was not enacted into law.
v. The Domestic Workers (Decent Working Conditions) Bill of 2015 sought to include domestic
workers under existing labour laws, such as the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947. The Bill proposed
ensuring fair wages and regulated working conditions for 31 | P a g e domestic workers. However, it
remained pending and was not enacted into law.
vi. The Domestic Workers Welfare Bill 2016 proposed including migrant and minor domestic
workers within its ambit. The Bill prescribed working conditions, terms of employment, and the
collection of a cess from employers to maintain a social security fund. It also mandated the
registration of workers by employers and placement agencies. This Bill was, however, not enacted.
vii. The Domestic Workers (Regulation of Work and Social Security) Bill, 2017 sought to regulate the
work of domestic workers, prescribe duties for employers and placement agencies, establish Boards
for their registration, address issues related to the marginalisation caused by migration, and provide
for the inclusion of domestic workers in significant labour laws. However, the Bill was never
enacted.
50. It, thus, seems to us that no effective legislative or executive action in furtherance of enacting a
statute, which could prove to be a boon to millions of vulnerable domestic workers across the
Ajay Malik vs State Of Uttarakhand on 29 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/79728784/
16
country, has been undertaken as of now. Over and above the absence of any legislation protecting
their interests, domestic labourers also find themselves excluded from existing labour laws as well.
These, inter alia, include statutes such as the Payment of Wages Act 1936, Equal Remuneration Act
1976, Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, 32 | P a g e Prohibition and
Redressal) Act, 2013, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, etc.
51. Be that as it may, we must also acknowledge that recent years have witnessed certain positive
developments aimed at improving the legal and social status of domestic workers in India. These
developments, while still in their initial stages of implementation, signal recognition of the need to
address the systemic neglect faced by this workforce. In this regard, reference may be made to the
Code on Wages, 2019, which introduces provisions to address the issue of minimum wages for
domestic workers. Moreover, statutes such as the Social Security Code of 2020 replace earlier
legislation, including the Unorganized Workers’ Social Security Act of 2008, bringing domestic
workers within the ambit of ‘unorganised workers’. This inclusion makes them eligible for various
benefits such as social security, health insurance, provident fund, and maternity benefits. Further,
the introduction of the e-Shram portal in 2021 has facilitated the creation of a centralised database
to identify and register migrant/domestic/unorganised workers, enabling their access to welfare
schemes.
52. It is equally noteworthy that despite the absence of comprehensive protections for domestic
workers through a Central Law, several States have taken initiatives to safeguard their rights and
welfare. Tamil Nadu established the Tamil Nadu Domestic Workers Welfare Board in 2007 under
the Tamil Nadu Manual Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Work) Act, 1982.
The Board administers various social 33 | P a g e security benefits, including education assistance,
marriage assistance, delivery assistance, accidental death compensation, and pensions. These
benefits are provided through monetary compensation at fixed rates. Maharashtra has enacted the
Maharashtra Domestic Workers Welfare Board Act, 2008, creating District Domestic Labour
Welfare Boards with tripartite representation from employers, employees, and the government. This
Act allows domestic workers to voluntarily register to access social security benefits, including
maternity and child care, education assistance, and medical expense reimbursement. Similarly,
Kerala introduced the Kerala Domestic Workers (Regulation and Welfare) Bill, 2021 to protect,
regulate, and improve the welfare of domestic workers. The Bill aims to ensure minimum wages, fair
treatment, and lawful payment for workers, many of whom are employed through third-party
agencies.
53. Amidst this backdrop, which motions the lack of specific protections covering domestic workers
in India, it becomes this Court's solemn duty and responsibility to intervene, exercise the doctrine of
parens patriae and forge the path leading to their proper welfare. In a catena of decisions,11 this
Court has repeatedly stepped in and laid down interim guidelines to protect vulnerable groups who
were utterly unprotected due to legal gaps. That being said, we do not presently deem it appropriate
to lay down an interim legal code which would govern the 11 Rudul Sah v. State of Bihar, (1983) 4
SCC 141; M.C. Mehta (2) v. Union of India, (1988) 1 SCC 471; Nilabati Bahera v. State of Orissa,

34 | P a g e working conditions of domestic workers. We say so, being cognizant of the factum that
ordinarily, the judiciary should not stray too far out of bounds, and expressly interfere in the
legislative domain. The democratic setup of this country may be likened to a tripartite machine,
fueled by the doctrine of separation of powers, without which it’s functioning shall surely come to a
grinding halt.
54. It is in this vein, that we once again repose our faith in the Legislature, and the elected
representatives of the Indian people, to take the imperative steps towards ensuring an equitable and
dignified life for domestic workers. In light of the same, we seek to dispose of these appeals with
certain pointed directions to the Government of India. E. CONCLUSION AND DIRECTIONS
55. In view of the foregoing analysis and conclusions arrived at hereinabove, we deem it appropriate
to invoke this Court’s extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution of India and issue
the following directions:
i. Ajay Malik’s appeal (SLP (Crl.) No. 8777/2022) is thus allowed and the Impugned
Judgement dated 01.09.2022 passed by High Court in Criminal Misc. Application
No. 96/2018 is accordingly set aside. Additionally, the FIR No. 60/2017 (Case Crime
No. 94/2017), Chargesheet and all other proceedings therefore arising qua him are
hereby quashed.
35 | P a g e ii. There is no merit in the appeal preferred by the State against Ashok
Kumar (SLP (Crl.) No. 15131/2024), and it is thus dismissed. Therefore, the High
Court’s order dated 12.01.2021 in Criminal Revision No. 173/2019 is upheld.
iii. The conclusions drawn in favour of Ajay Malik and Ashok Kumar shall have no bearing on the
criminal proceedings pending against the other accused, including those who are alleged to have
exploited the Complainant on the pretext of securing her employment. Those proceedings shall be
decided as per their own merits.
iv. As regard to the larger issue of the protection of rights of domestic workers, we direct the
Ministry of Labour and Employment in tandem with the Ministry of Social Justice and
Empowerment, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, and the Ministry of Law and
Justice, to jointly constitute a Committee comprising subject experts to consider the desirability of
recommending a legal framework for the benefit, protection and regulation of the rights of domestic
workers.
v. The composition of the Expert Committee is left to the wisdom of the Government of India and its
concerned Ministries. It will be appreciated if the Committee submits a Report within a period of 6
months, whereupon the Government of India may consider the 36 | P a g e necessity of introducing
a legal framework which may effectively address the cause and concern of domestic workers.
