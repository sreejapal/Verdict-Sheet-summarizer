SANJAY KUMAR, J
1. Leave granted.
2. Mohan Singh was killed on 06.11.2009 during the evening hours. F.I.R. No. 458 of 2009 was
thereupon registered by his father, Devisingh, on the file of P.S. Kishanpura Ganj, District Indore.
The time of registration of the F.I.R. was mentioned therein as 08:30 pm on 06.11.2009 while the
time of occurrence of the offence was shown as 06:30 pm on that day. Five men, viz., Arun,
Radheshyam, Narendra, Abhay Singh and Ramlal (the last was the only one named as an accused in
the F.I.R.) stood trial for the murder of Mohan Singh and other offences. By judgment dated
27.06.2013 in Sessions Trial No. 213 of 2010, the learned II Additional Sessions Judge, Mhow,
District Indore, held them guilty on all counts. They were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for
life for the murder of Mohan Singh under Section 302 IPC read with Section 34 IPC. They were
visited with lesser sentences for the other offences along with fines, coupled with default
imprisonment.

3. Assailing the judgment of the Trial Court, all five of them jointly filed Criminal Appeal No.932 of
2013 before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore. By judgment dated 25.01.2024, a Division
Bench of the High Court allowed the said appeal insofar as it pertained to Abhay Singh and
acquitted him of all charges but dismissed the appeal apropos the remaining four appellants and
confirmed their convictions and sentences. Aggrieved thereby, Arun, Radheshyam, Narendra and
Ramlal are before us by way of these appeals by special leave.
4. The prosecution’s case was that, at about 05.00 pm on that fateful day, Vijay Dongre came to visit
his friend, Mohan Singh, at his village, Bhatkhadi. After some time, Vijay Dongre requested Mohan
Singh to drop him at Chowpatty on his motorcycle. Abhay, son of Gopal, the brother of Mohan
Singh, also accompanied them to get a haircut. All three of them accordingly proceeded on the
motorcycle to Chowpatty. After dropping Vijay Dongre there and after Abhay got his haircut at a
saloon near Chowpatty, Mohan Singh and Abhay started back on the motorcycle. The fatal attack on
Mohan Singh is stated to have taken place at that time.
5. The homicidal death of Mohan Singh stands confirmed by the post-mortem report (Ex. P-3) and
the evidence of Dr. L.S. Verma (PW-2), who was one of the doctors who conducted the post-mortem.
He confirmed that Mohan Singh had sustained 5 wounds and that the cause of his death was shock
and internal and external hemorrhage due to a gunshot wound and other injuries to vital organs.
During his cross- examination, however, Dr. L.S. Verma (PW-2) conceded to the effect that Wound
No.1 was not a gunshot wound but was caused by a stabbing weapon.
6. Devisingh, father of Mohan Singh, had lodged the F.I.R. shortly after his death. Therein, he stated
that, at around 06.30pm, Abhay said to him that 3-4 persons were beating his ‘elder father’, Mohan
Singh, and that blood was oozing out from his abdomen. Devisingh said that he went running there
and, in the meanwhile, his daughter-in-law also reached there. He found the vehicle of Mohan Singh
parked along the road and he saw two persons absconding - one was Ramlal, son of Devaji, and the
other was dressed in a suit and was wearing shoes. They were running towards Manpur. Devisingh
said that Mohan Singh was shot and his head was crushed with stones and he had been murdered by
firing a bullet into his abdomen. This was the initial information given by Devisingh.
7. As many as twenty-five witnesses were examined by the prosecution to prove its case. However,
the oral evidence that was adduced before the Trial Court by Devisingh and his family members was,
in our opinion, clearly embellished and augmented so as to implicate and indict the five men who
stood accused of the murder of Mohan Singh.
8. Devisingh deposed as PW-1. He stated that after Mohan Singh left to Chowpatty with his nephew,
Abhay, and Vijay Dongre, the five accused passed by their field at about 05.30 pm, heading towards
Chowpatty. He, along with Madhubala, his daughter-in-law, and his son, Mehar Singh, saw them.
He stated that Madhubala entertained a doubt as these persons had enmity with them due to a land
dispute and she, along with his other son, Gopal, went towards Chowpatty. He claimed that he also
went behind them. He further stated that about 10 feet away from the place of the incident, Abhay
met them and told them that 4-5 persons were beating his ‘elder father’ and his abdomen was
bleeding. They also reached the place of the incident and saw that there were people beating the

deceased. Upon seeing him, Ramlal and Abhay Singh ran away towards Chowpatty while Arun and
others ran towards their fields nearby. Devisingh claimed that he saw them hitting with stones. He
said that his son was lying dead in a 10 feet deep pit and his head was crushed by stones.
9. In his cross-examination, Devisingh said that it would take 5 to 7 minutes from his field to reach
the spot where his son’s body was found. He stated that his son had left for Chowpatty between
05.00 – 05.30 pm. He said that Madhubala, Gopal and Mehar Singh did not leave 2-3 minutes after
Mohan Singh left and added that he himself left at 06.00 pm for Chowpatty and Gopal, Mehar Singh
and Madhubala were with him. They reached the place of the incident within 5-7 minutes.
Devisingh’s version before the Trial Court was, therefore, entirely different from what he had
originally stated and was recorded in the F.I.R.
10. Madhubala, the wife of Mohan Singh, deposed as PW-4. She said that the incident took place at
06.00 - 06.30 pm on 06.11.2009. According to her, Mohan Singh, along with Vijay Dongre and
Abhay, left for Chowpatty at 05.30 pm on a motorcycle. She claimed that after their departure, all
the accused went towards Chowpatty and she felt suspicious about them, as they had enmity with
her husband. She told her father-in-law, Devisingh, and brother-in-law, Gopal, and they all started
towards Chowpatty. When they were nearing Chowpatty, Abhay, who was standing on the road,
came running and told her that his uncle was being beaten by some people of the village. She ran
and crossed the road. At that time, she heard the sound of a gunshot. When she reached near,
Ramlal of their village was throwing stones at her husband’s back while Arun had a pistol in his
hand and he was also throwing stones. Radheshyam was picking up stones and hitting her husband
on his back and Narendra Singh was also doing so. When her brother-in-law and father-in-law came
near, the accused ran away.
11. Mehar Singh, brother of Mohan Singh, deposed as PW-6. He spoke on the same lines as his
sister-in-law, Madhubala. Significantly, Devisingh did not say he heard a gunshot but Madhubala
and Mehar Singh said so. Gopal, the other brother and father of Abhay, the child witness, deposed
as PW-8. He also did not hear a gunshot but stated that he saw the accused, Arun, holding a revolver
in his hand. He further stated that he saw the other four accused throwing stones at Mohan Singh
and that the accused ran away when they shouted.
12. Abhay (PW-11) was a crucial witness as he was the one who is stated to have accompanied
Mohan Singh and would have been with him at the time of the attack. He was about 07 years of age
when he deposed before the Trial Court on 24.02.2011. He would have, therefore, been about 06
years old on 06.11.2009. He also gave graphic details of the accused attacking Mohan Singh.
According to him, the accused hit their motorcycle but even after the collusion they were still sitting
on it. Arun, one of the accused, then shot his uncle in the stomach while the other four accused
threw stones on his face. He started running from there and found his mother nearby. He also
claimed that he informed the police about these details.
13. In his cross-examination, Abhay unwittingly spoke of the events at Chowpatty. He stated that
Mohan Singh took him along with his friend to a friend’s hotel at Chowpatty where they had tea.
According to him, they stayed there for half an hour and it was only thereafter, they started to the

Housing from Chowpatty to get him a haircut. He said that it took about half an hour to get his
haircut. Abhay further stated that the police had interrogated him only once and his statement was
recorded.
14. Notably, D.S. Parmar, the Investigating Officer, who deposed as PW-20, admitted that Abhay’s
statement under Section 161 Cr.P.C. was recorded only on 23.11.2009, that is, 17 days after the
incident. Similarly, the statement of Madhubala (PW-4) was also recorded after 17 days and the
statement of Gopal (PW-8) was recorded after 7 days. This delay on the part of the Investigating
Officer in recording the statements of these so-called crucial witnesses is unfathomable, given their
availability and the versions given by them. It casts a cloud on the very veracity of their testimonies.
Further, the discrepancies in the timelines brought out by them demonstrates in no uncertain terms
that the narratives of these witnesses are not free from suspicion and doubt.
15. According to Devisingh, they left at 06.00 pm and it only took about 5 to 7 minutes from their
field to reach the spot where the deceased was found. According to all these witnesses, Mohan
Singh, along with Vijay Dongre and Abhay, left for Chowpatty at 05.30 pm. Abhay, the child witness,
said that they spent half an hour having tea and another half an hour at the barber’s shop.
Therefore, they could not have started back to the village before 06.30pm. However, the incident is
stated to have occurred at that time or even earlier, going by their timelines. To compound matters
further, Vijay Dongre, the friend of Mohan Singh, who deposed as PW-5, stated that he had gone to
meet Mohan Singh at 05:30-05:45 pm in the evening on 06.11.2009 and stayed with him at his farm
for about 15-20 minutes. He stated that he, along with Mohan Singh and Abhay, left the farm
thereafter to go to Chowpatty. According to him, the distance from the farm to Chowpatty is about 2
½ kms but it would be 3 kms by the road leading to the Housing Square. He stated that, after
leaving him at Chowpatty, Mohan Singh told him that he would go to the Housing Square for
Abhay’s haircut. He said that when Mohan Singh left him at Chowpatty, it was about 06:15- 06:30
pm. Juxtaposing the versions of Vijay Dongre (PW-5) and Abhay (PW-11), it is clear that Mohan
Singh and Abhay could not have been at the spot where the attack took place by 06:30 pm. Abhay
had stated that the haircut took half an hour and, at the very least, it would have been 06:45 pm by
the time the haircut was completed. The timelines, therefore, do not match.
16. As the maxim ‘Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus’ (false in one thing, false in everything) is not
part of Indian law and jurisprudence and is, at best, a rule of caution, the entire evidence of these
witnesses need not be discarded because some of their statements are proved to be factually
incorrect. However, their depositions would have to be viewed with care and caution before they are
accepted and acted upon. In this regard, we may note that the enmity between the family of the
deceased and some of the accused was admitted by the family members themselves. Their
depositions before the Trial Court, naming all the accused and attributing specific overt acts to each
of them, would have to be examined very carefully, given the variance in the initial version in the
F.I.R. In fact, this inconsistency dented the prosecution’s case in entirety even against Ramlal.
17. All that Devisingh had reported at the time of registration of the F.I.R. was that he saw Ramlal,
one of the five accused, and a man wearing a suit and shoes, who remained unknown, running away
from the spot. He did not name any of the other accused but his deposition before the Trial Court

was very much to the contrary, as he not only named them but also attributed specific overt acts to
them. Similarly, the other family members, whose very presence at the spot becomes rather
doubtful, furnished full-fledged details of how the accused attacked Mohan Singh. In this regard, the
evidence of D.S. Parmar, the Investigating Officer (PW-20), assumes great significance. He
categorically asserted that none of these witnesses had stated the versions that they put forth before
the Trial Court in their Section 161 Cr.P.C. statements. He affirmed that Devisingh, in his statement
(Ex. D-
1), had stated as was recorded in the F.I.R. and did not mention anything about
Madhubala, his daughter-in-law, becoming suspicious and about he, along with his
other family members, going towards Chowpatty.
18. The only other incriminating circumstance relied upon by the prosecution was the recovery of a
12-bore country made pistol from Arun, one of the appellants. However, surprisingly, no bullet was
recovered from the body of Mohan Singh, the deceased, though there is no evidence of any exit
wound. Further, Dr. L.S. Verma (PW-2) candidly admitted to the effect that what was initially stated
by him to be a gunshot wound was actually caused by a stabbing weapon. In consequence, the cause
of Mohan Singh’s death being a ‘gunshot wound’ is itself open to question and, therefore, the
so-called recovery of the pistol from Arun does not help the prosecution.
19. As matters stand, the entire case of the prosecution hinges only upon the oral evidence of the
family members of Mohan Singh, the deceased. However, as already noted hereinbefore, their
evidence is found to be completely untrustworthy and specious. Conviction of the appellants cannot
rest solely on such doubtful testimonies. The Trial Court and the High Court erred in the
appreciation of this dubious oral evidence and in drawing the proper inferences therefrom. The
appellants would invariably have to be given the benefit of doubt in such circumstances, as the
prosecution failed to prove the charges levelled against them beyond reasonable doubt.
20. On the above analysis, the appeals are allowed, setting aside the judgment dated 25.01.2024
passed by the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore in Criminal Appeal No. 932 of 2013 as well
as the judgment dated 27.06.2013 passed by the learned II Additional Sessions Judge, Mhow,
District Indore, in Sessions Trial No. 213 of 2010. All the appellants shall stand acquitted of the
charged offences.
By order dated 12.02.2025, we had suspended the sentences of Arun, Narendra and Radheshyam
and directed their release on terms and conditions to be fixed by the Trial Court. Therefore, as on
date, only Ramlal remains in custody. Ramlal shall also be set at liberty forthwith, unless his
continued incarceration is lawfully required in connection with any other case. Bail Bonds and
sureties furnished by the other appellants shall stand discharged. Fine amounts paid by the
appellants, if any, shall be refunded to them.
