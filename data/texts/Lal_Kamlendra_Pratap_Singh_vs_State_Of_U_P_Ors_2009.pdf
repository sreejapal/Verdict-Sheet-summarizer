                                     ORDER
Heard learned counsel for the parties.
Leave granted.
The appeal by Special leave has been filed against the impugned Judgment dated 3.9.2007 of the
Allahabad High Court in Criminal Miscellaneous Writ Petition No.13227/2007. The aforesaid writ
Petition was filed for quashing the F.I.R. in case Crime No.1133/2007 under Sections
467,468,471,420,409 and 218 I.P.C., Police Station Mahoba, District Mahoba, U.P. By the impugned
Judgment, the High Court refused to quash the F.I.R. but directed that if the appellant surrenders
within 10 days, his bail application will be considered and disposed of expeditiously.
Aggrieved by that order this appeal has been filed.
By an interim order dated 30.11.2007 this Court directed that the petitioner shall not be arrested in

We are today informed by Shri S.R.Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of U.P. that
charge sheet has been filed and congnizance has been taken and the case is now pending before the
trial Court. In these circumstances, he submitted that we should not exercise our discretion under
Article 136 of the Constitution of India for quashing the F.I.R.
Learned counsel for the appellant apprehends that the appellant will be arrested as there is no
provision for anticipatory bail in the State of U.P. He placed reliance on a decision of the Allahabad
High Court in the case of Amaravati Vs. State of U.P. 2005 Crl.L.J 755 in which a Seven Judge Full
Bench of the Allahabad High Court held that the Court, if it deems fit in the facts and circumstances
of the case, may grant interim bail pending final disposal of the bail application. The Full Bench also
observed that arrest is not a must whenever an F.I.R. of a cognizable offence is lodged. The Full
Bench placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Joginder Kumar Vs. State of U.P., 1994
Cr.L.J.1981.
We fully agree with the view of the High in Amaravati's case (supra), and we direct that the said
decision be followed by all Courts in U.P. in letter and spirit, particularly since the provision for
anticipatory bail does not exist in U.P. In appropriate cases interim bail should be granted pending
disposal of the final bail application, since arrest and detention of a person can cause irreparable
loss to a person's reputation, as held by this Court in Joginder Kumar's case (supra). Also, arrest is
not a must in all cases of cognizable offences, and in deciding whether to arrest or not the police
officer must be guided and act according to the principles laid down in Joginder Kumar's case
(supra).
Since, charge sheet has been filed and cognizance has been taken, and on the facts of this case, in
our opinion, this is not a fit case for quashing the first information report. The Appeal is dismissed,
However, the appellant is granted time to appear before the trial Court on or before 15th April, 2009
and to file an application for bail. If such an application is filed, the trial Court shall consider the
same on its own merits in accordance with law, and if it so deems fit, grant interim bail to the
appellant pending the final disposal of his bail application.
Let a copy of this judgment be sent to the Registrar General of the Allahabad High Court who will
circulate it to all Hon'ble Judges of the High Court and send copies to all District Judges in the State.
