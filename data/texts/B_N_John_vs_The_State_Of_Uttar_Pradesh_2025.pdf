NONGMEIKAPAM KOTISWAR SINGH, J.
Leave granted.
2. The present appeal has been preferred being aggrieved by the judgment dated 22.09.2023 passed
by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 (‘CrPC’ for short) in Application No. 35311 of 2023 by which the appellant’s plea for quashing
of the chargesheet No.162 of 2015 dated 20.06.2015, order dated 11.08.2015 taking cognizance and
issuing summons, and the entire proceedings in Case No. 9790 of 2015 arising out of Case Crime
No. 290 of 2015 under Sections 353 and 186 of the Indian Date: 2025.01.02 16:15:09 IST Reason:
Penal Code, 1860 (‘IPC’ for short), P.S. Cantt. District Varanasi, U.P., was rejected.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
3. It is the plea of the appellant that he is the owner of the premises and was in charge
of managing & maintaining the hostel, which was being operated by a
Non-Governmental Organization, named Sampoorna Development India. This hostel
at the relevant time was used for underprivileged children by providing facilities for
their accommodation, education and other needs.
3.1 According to the appellant, because of certain personal disputes with one K.V.
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
1
Abraham, the latter instituted six false cases against him, four of them resulted in his
acquittal, while in the other two discharge applications are pending. According to the
appellant, it was at the instance of the said Abraham that the officials conducted a
raid in the said hostel arbitrarily without authorization and also without providing
any prior notice, alleging that provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection
of Children) Act, 2015 (‘JJ Act’ for short) as applicable then, were not followed in
running and managing the said hostel.
3.2 It is the allegation of the appellant that the officials illegally conducted the raid on
03.06.2015 and sought to transfer the children accommodated in the said hostel to
some other location purportedly on the ground that the hostel was being run without
proper authorization from the competent authority under the JJ Act.
3.3. It was further contended that a false allegation was made against the appellant
that he, along with his party, had attacked and assaulted the officials while they were
conducting the raid in connection with which an FIR came to be lodged against the
appellant and his wife, which was registered as FIR No. 290 of 2015 dated
03.06.2015 at the PS Cantt.
District, Varanasi under Section 353 of the IPC.
3.4. On the basis of the said FIR, the appellant was arrested on 08.06.2015. However, he was
granted bail on the same day. Subsequently, on completion of the investigation, charge-sheet was
filed before the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Varanasi in connection with the said FIR on
20.06.2015 alleging commission of offences under Sections 353 and 186 of the IPC.
3.5. Pursuant to the filing of the chargesheet, the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Varanasi took
cognizance and issued summons to the appellant vide order dated 11.08.2015, against which the
appellant submitted an application for recalling the said order, which is pending before the Court of
CJM, Varanasi.
3.6. According to the appellant, a complaint alleging commission of an offence under Section 186 of
the IPC would be maintainable only if it is preceded by a complaint filed by a public servant as
mentioned under Section 195 (1)(a) of the CrPC before the court/Magistrate, but there was no such
prior complaint filed by any public servant before the Magistrate.
Further, though the FIR was filed under Section 353 of the IPC, there were no ingredients to make
out a case under the said section. It is also the case of the appellant that the authorities had
maliciously invoked the penal provision of Section 353 of the IPC in the FIR merely to make out a
cognizable offence against the appellant to enable the Magistrate to take cognizance, even though
there was no case of any assault or use of criminal force by the appellant to deter any public servant
from discharging his duty. Hence, taking cognizance of the said FIR by the CJM, Varanasi under
Section 353 of the IPC was unwarranted and illegal.

3.7 Accordingly, the appellant approached the Allahabad High Court invoking jurisdiction under
Section 482 of the CrPC seeking quashing of the aforesaid proceedings, that is, Crime Case No. 290
of 2015 pending before the CJM, Varanasi and orders taking cognizance and issuing summons in
that regard.
3.8 The Allahabad High Court on perusal of the FIR No.290/15 and the statement of witnesses
recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC held that a prima facie case has been made out against the
appellant for being summoned and for prosecution under the aforesaid Sections 353 and 186 of the
IPC and declined his plea for quashing the aforesaid criminal case which was pending before the
CJM, Varanasi.
3.9 While dismissing the petition filed by the appellant, the Allahabad High Court referred to an
earlier decision of the High Court in rejecting the application filed by the co-accused seeking
quashing of the aforesaid proceedings under Section 482 of the CrPC which was affirmed by this
Court on 13.04.2017 by dismissing the SLP in limine.
In the present impugned order, the High Court observed that the allegations against the present
appellant and co-accused are same as well as the evidence collected against them and since the plea
of quashing the charge sheet and cognizance taken against the said co-accused had already been
rejected on merits by the High Court, which was not disturbed by this Court, no interference was
warranted for quashing the proceedings under Section 482 of the CrPC, filed by the present
appellant and dismissed the petition. Accordingly, the appellant is before us.
SUBMISSION OF THE APPELLANT
4. It is the specific plea of the appellant that cognizance in respect of an offence under Section 186 of
the IPC can be taken by the court only after a complaint is made in writing by the public servant to
the court as provided under Section 195 (1) of the Cr.P.C. It has been submitted that in the present
case no such written complaint was filed by any public official as also ascertained by him from the
concerned authority through an application filed to the competent authority under the Right to
Information Act, 2005, whereby he was informed that no written complaint was filed before the
court by any public servant in connection with Case No. 9790 of 2015 (State Vs B.N. John and Anr.).
4.1 Further, for invoking the provision of Section 353 of the IPC there must be a clear allegation of
assault or criminal force by the accused for preventing the public servant from discharging his duty.
However, a careful reading of the FIR would indicate that no such allegation was made against the
appellant of using criminal force or assault and accordingly, even if the allegations made in the FIR
are taken at their face value, it does not disclose the commission of any cognizable offence as
contemplated under Section 353 of the IPC.
4.2 Accordingly, it has been submitted that taking cognizance by the CJM, Varanasi, of the aforesaid
case under the stated facts and circumstances is quite illegal and perverse in law, as such, the same
ought to have been quashed by the Allahabad High Court. It was contended that the Allahabad High
Court, however, had misdirected itself by observing that a prima facie case is made out on the basis
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
3
of the contents of the FIR and the statement of the witnesses recorded under Section 161 CrPC.
4.3 It has also been contended that the Allahabad High Court in the present case ought not to have
taken into consideration the order passed in respect of the other co-accused, as the legal issues as
highlighted in this appeal, were not considered by the Allahabad High Court while rejecting the plea
of the co-accused for quashing the complaint. As such, the said decision cannot be used against the
present appellant.
PLEA OF THE RESPONDENT
5. Per contra, it has been submitted on behalf of the State that the decision rendered by the
Allahabad High Court is in consonance with the law and no grievance can be made as the High
Court had applied the relevant law to the facts of the present case.
Further, it has also been submitted that this Court must be very slow in interfering with a reasoned
order passed by the High Court, and the impugned order cannot be said to be perverse, illegal, or
without any jurisdiction. It was contended that merely because a different view could have been
taken by the High Court, it does not render the decision of the High Court illegal, warranting
interference from this Court, and the High Court passed the order after going through the records.
ANALYSIS
6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.
7. As far as quashing of criminal cases is concerned, it is now more or less well settled as regards to
the principles to be applied by the court. In this regard, one may refer to the decision of this Court in
State of Haryana Vs. Ch. Bhajan Lal and Ors., 1992 Supp. (1) SCC 335 wherein this Court has
summarized some of the principles under which FIR/complaints/criminal cases could be quashed in
the following words:
“102. In the backdrop of the interpretation of the various relevant provisions of the
Code under Chapter XIV and of the principles of law enunciated by this Court in a
series of decisions relating to the exercise of the extraordinary power under Article
226 or the inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code which we have extracted
and reproduced above, we give the following categories of cases by way of illustration
wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any
court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice, though it may not be possible to lay
down any precise, clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible
guidelines or rigid formulae and to give an exhaustive list of myriad kinds of cases
wherein such power should be exercised.
(1) Where the allegations made in the first information report or the complaint, even
if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie
constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused. (2) Where the
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
4
allegations in the first information report and other materials, if any, accompanying
the FIR do not disclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation by police
officers under Section 156(1) of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within
the purview of Section 155(2) of the Code.
(3) Where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the
evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any
offence and make out a case against the accused.
(4) Where, the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by a police
officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155(2) of the
Code.
(5) Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently
improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion
that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused.
(6) Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code
or the concerned Act (under which a criminal proceeding is instituted) to the
institution and continuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a specific
provision in the Code or the concerned Act, providing efficacious redress for the
grievance of the aggrieved party.
(7) Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and/or where
the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking
vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal
grudge.” (emphasis added)
8. Of the aforesaid criteria, clauses no. (1), (4) and (6) would be of relevance to us in this case.
In clause (1) it has been mentioned that where the allegations made in the first information report or
the complaint, even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima
facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the accused, then the FIR or the complaint
can be quashed.
As per clause (4), where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but
constitute only a non-cognizable offence, no investigation is permitted by police officer without an
order dated by the Magistrate as contemplated under Section 155 (2) of the CrPC, and in such a
situation, the FIR can be quashed.
Similarly, as provided under clause (6), if there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the
provisions of the CrPC or the concerned Act under which the criminal proceedings is instituted, such
proceeding can be quashed.

9. Our criminal justice system, rooted in the rule of law, contemplates different approaches for
dealing with serious and non-serious offences. When complaints pertaining to serious offences are
filed, which are generally categorized as cognizable offences under the CrPC, the police, on receiving
such information of the commission of a cognizable offence can immediately start the investigation
as contemplated under Section 156 of the CrPC. On the other hand, when it relates to non-serious
offences which are generally categorized as non-cognizable offences, the law is more circumspect in
letting the full force of the criminal justice system operate. When it is related to non-cognizable
offence there are certain safeguards put in place so that the invasive, intrusive, and coercive power
of the police is not immediately brought into operation, as enabled under Section 156 of the CrPC. In
such a situation any complaint alleging commission of non-serious offence(s) or non-cognizable
offence(s) made before the police, has to be vetted by a legally trained person in the presence of a
Judicial Magistrate before the police can initiate the investigation. Thus, even if the police receives
any such complaint relating to non-cognizable offence, the police cannot start investigation without
there being a green signal from the Magistrate. Further, when such non- cognizable offence(s)
pertaining to officials who are obstructed from discharging their official duties, there is the
additional safeguard before the Magistrate which permits the investigating authority to investigate.
It must be preceded by a complaint filed by a public servant before the court/Magistrate. This is to
ensure that only genuine complaints relating to non-serious offences or non-cognizable offences are
entertained by the Magistrate. This is so for the reason that in a democracy, interactions of the
citizen with the public servants is more frequent in wherein there may be instances where the
members of the public cause obstruction to public servants preventing them from discharging public
duties properly.
With these safeguards, the fine balance between the liberties of the citizens and the imperatives of
the State endowed with coercive authority to maintain law and order is preserved.
10. Keeping the aforesaid principles and aspects in mind, we shall proceed to examine the issues and
contentions of the parties before us.
11. Chapter XII of the CrPC deals with information given to the police and their powers to
investigate.
Section 155 (2) of the CrPC provides that when information is given to an officer in charge of a police
station of the commission within the limits of such station of a non-cognizable offence, he shall
enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept by such officer in
such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf, and refer the informant to the
Magistrate. Section 155(2) of the CrPC further provides that no police officer shall investigate a
non-cognizable case without the order of a Magistrate having power to try such a case or commit the
case for trial.
Relevant portions of Section 155 of the CrPC reads as under:
“155. Information as to non-cognizable cases and investigation of such cases.— (1)
When information is given to an officer in charge of a police station of the
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
6
commission within the limits of such station of a non-cognizable offence, he shall
enter or cause to be entered the substance of the information in a book to be kept by
such officer in such form as the State Government may prescribe in this behalf, and
refer the informant to the Magistrate.
(2) No police officer shall investigate a non-cognizable case without the order of a
Magistrate having power to try such case or commit the case for trial.
…………………………………………………………..
……………………………………………………………” Thus, there is a specific bar on the police to investigate
any such non-cognizable offence, without the order of a Magistrate.
12. However, no such bar has been placed when it relates to a cognizable offence as provided under
Sections 154 and 156 of the CrPC, under which, any officer in charge of a police station may, without
the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case that a court having jurisdiction over the
local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try under the
provisions of Chapter XII, as reproduced herein below:
“154. Information in cognizable cases.—(1) Every information relating to the
commission of a cognizable offence, if given orally to an officer in charge of a police
station, shall be reduced to writing by him or under his direction, and be read over to
the informant; and every such information, whether given in writing or reduced to
writing as aforesaid, shall be signed by the person giving it, and the substance thereof
shall be entered in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as the State
Government may prescribe in this behalf:
Provided that if ……………………………………………” “156. Police officer’s power to
investigate cognizable case.— (1) Any officer in charge of a police station may,
without the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case which a Court
having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have
power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII.
(2) …………………………………………………..
………………………………………………………….”
13. While Section 155 of the CrPC deals with all non-cognizable offences, where the police cannot
investigate without a prior order of the Magistrate, Section 195 of the CrPC provides additional
conditions under which the Magistrates can take cognizance in respect of certain kinds of
non-cognizable offences as mentioned in the said section, which includes Section 186 of the IPC
with which we are directly concerned, only after a written complaint is filed by the concerned public
servant to the court/Magistrate.
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/

Relevant portions of Section 195 of the CrPC read as follows:
“195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants, for offences
against public justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence.
(1) No Court shall take cognizance—
(a) (i) of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the
Indian Penal Code, (45 of 1860), or
(ii) of any abetment of, or attempt to commit, such offence, or
(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit such offence, except on the complaint in
writing of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is
administratively subordinate;
……………………………………… ………………………………………….”
14. Since, the appellant has been charged for committing offences under Sections 186 and 353 of the
IPC, it may be appropriate to reproduce the same.
Section 186 of the IPC reads as follows:
“186. Obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions.—Whoever
voluntarily obstructs any public servant in the discharge of his public functions, shall
be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to
three months, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both.
Section 353 of the IPC reads as follows:
“353. Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his
duty.—Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant
in the execution of his duty as such public servant, or with intent to prevent or deter
that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, or in consequence of
anything done or attempted to be done by such person to the lawful discharge of his
duty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.”
15. A bare perusal of Section 195 (1) of the CrPC clearly indicates that there is a bar on the court to
take cognizance of any offence punishable under Section 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the IPC
except on a complaint in writing made by the concerned public servant to the court. Therefore, if it
is found as contended by the appellant that in respect of the offence under Section 186 of the IPC
against him, no such complaint was filed by the concerned public servant as contemplated under
Section 195 (1)(a) CrPC, the CJM could not have taken cognizance of the offence under Section 186
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
8
of the IPC.
In this regard, the appellant has specifically pleaded to which there is no rebuttal from the State that
no such complaint was made in writing by a public servant as required under Section 195(1) of the
CrPC relating to the commission of offence by the appellant under Section 186 of the IPC.
16. The State has, however, made a feeble attempt to show that there was indeed a complaint filed by
the District Probation Officer to the City Magistrate, Varanasi, on 03.06.2015, alleging that the
appellants and his party were creating obstructions to the officials in the process of sending the
minor children residing in the institution run illegally by Sampoorn Development India to other
approved institutions and requested the City Magistrate to take cognizance of the same and take
legal action.
The aforesaid complaint reads as follows:
“To, City magistrate Varanasi Sir, By your order dated June 3, 2015, letter no. 1346,
Mr B.N. John, Ms Susan John and their people are creating obstruction in the
process of sending the minor children residing in the non-legal institution run by the
Sampoorna Development Trust to other Institutions legally. Please take cognizance of
this and take further legal action.
Sincerely Prabhat Ranjan 03/06/2013 District Probation Officer.
Station Head Cantt/CO Cantt.
S/O is creating obstruction in important work necessary action.”
17. A careful examination of the aforesaid letter, however, would reveal the following crucial aspect.
The said letter in the form of complaint is addressed to the City Magistrate and not to any Judicial
Magistrate. As to what is a complaint is defined under Section 2 (d) of the CrPC which reads as
follows:
“2. Definitions.—In this Code, unless the context otherwise requires,
(a) ……………………………
(b) ……………………………
(c) ……………………. ……..
(d) “complaint” means any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate, with a
view to his taking action under this Code, that some person, whether known or
unknown, has committed an offence, but does not include a police report.
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025

Thus, a complaint within the meaning and scope of the Criminal Procedure Code would mean such a
complaint filed before a Judicial Magistrate and not an Executive Magistrate.
18. As regards the difference between a Judicial Magistrate and an Executive Magistrate, it has been
clarified by this Court in Gulam Abbas v. State of U.P., (1982) 1 SCC 71 as follows:
“24. Turning to the 1973 Code itself the scheme of separating Judicial Magistrates
from Executive Magistrates with allocation of judicial functions to the former and the
executive or administrative functions to the latter, as we shall presently indicate, has
been implemented in the Code to a great extent. Section 6 provides that there shall be
in every State four classes of criminal courts, namely,
(i) Courts of Session, (ii) Judicial Magistrates of the First class and, in any
metropolitan area, Metropolitan Magistrates;(iii) Judicial Magistrates of the Second
Class; and (iv) Executive Magistrates; Sections 8 to 19 provide inter alia for
declaration of metropolitan area, establishment of Courts of Session, Courts of
Judicial Magistrates, Courts of Metropolitan Magistrates and appointments of
Sessions Judges, Additional Sessions Judges, Assistant Sessions Judges, Chief
Judicial Magistrates, Judicial Magistrates, Chief Metropolitan Magistrates and
Metropolitan Magistrates together with inter se subordination, but all appointments
being required to be made by the High Court, while Sections 20, 21, 22 and 23 deal
with appointments of District Magistrates, Additional District Magistrates, Executive
Magistrates, Sub-Divisional Magistrates and Special Executive Magistrates and their
respective jurisdictions in every district and metropolitan area together with inter se
subordination, but appointments being made by the State Government. Chapter III
comprising Sections 26 to 35 clearly shows that Executive Magistrates are totally
excluded from conferment of powers to punish, which are conferred on Judicial
Magistrates; this shows that if any one were to commit a breach of any order passed
by an Executive Magistrate in exercise of his administrative or executive function he
will have to be challenged or prosecuted before a Judicial Magistrate to receive
punishment on conviction. Further, if certain sections of the present Code are
compared with the equivalent sections in the old Code it will appear clear that a
separation between judicial functions and executive or administrative functions has
been achieved by assigning substantially the former to the Judicial Magistrates and
the latter to the Executive Magistrates. For example, the power under Section 106 to
release a person on conviction of certain types of offences by obtaining from him
security by way of execution of bond for keeping peace and good behaviour for a
period not exceeding three years — a judicial function is now exclusively entrusted to
a Judicial Magistrate whereas under Section 106 of the old Code such power could be
exercised by a Presidency Magistrate, a District Magistrate or Sub-Divisional
Magistrate; but the power to direct the execution of a similar bond by way of security
for keeping peace in other cases where such a person is likely to commit breach of
peace or disturb the public tranquillity — an executive function of police to maintain
law and order and public peace which was conferred on a Presidency Magistrate,
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
10
District Magistrate, etc. under the old Section 107 is now assigned exclusively to the
Executive Magistrate under the present Section 107; Chapter X of the new Code deals
with the topic of maintenance of public order and tranquillity and in that Chapter
Sections 129 to 132 deal with unlawful assemblies and dispersal thereof, Sections 133
to 143 deal with public nuisance and abatement or removal thereof, Section 144 deals
with urgent cases of nuisance and apprehended danger to public tranquillity and
Sections 145 to 148 deal with disputes as to immovable properties likely to cause
breach of peace — all being in the nature of executive (“police”) functions, powers in
that behalf have been vested exclusively in Executive Magistrates whereas under
equivalent provisions under the old Code such powers were conferred
indiscriminately on any Magistrate, whether Judicial or Executive. In particular it
may be stated that whereas under the old Section 144 the power to take action in
urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger to public tranquillity had been
conferred on “a District Magistrate, a Chief Presidency Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional
Magistrate or any other Magistrate, specially empowered by the State Government”,
under the present Section 144 the power has been conferred on “a District
Magistrate, a Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate specially
empowered by the State Government in that behalf”. Having regard to such
implementation of the concept of separation of judicial functions from executive or
administrative functions and allocation of the former to the Judicial Magistrates and
the latter to the Executive Magistrates under the Code of 1973, it will be difficult to
accept the contention of the counsel for Respondents 5 and 6 that the order passed by
a District Magistrate, Sub-Divisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate
under the present Section 144 is a judicial or quasi-
judicial order, the function thereunder being essentially an executive (police) function.
………………………….”
19. Since the Magistrate referred to under Section 155 under Chapter XII of the CrPC refers to a
Magistrate who has the power to try such case or commit the case for trial and thus exercises judicial
function, he has to be a Judicial Magistrate. Further, under Section 195 (1) of the CrPC read with
Section 2 (d) of the CrPC, the complaint, has to be filed before the court taking cognizance, and the
complaint which is required to be filed under Section 195 (1) of the CrPC, can only be before a
Judicial Magistrate and not an Executive Magistrate who does not have the power to take
cognizance of an offence or try such cases.
20. In the present case, since the complaint was filed before the City Magistrate and not before a
Judicial Magistrate, the requirement of Section 195 (1) of the CrPC was not fulfilled.
21. Under such circumstances, we are satisfied that the appellant has been able to make out a case
that taking cognizance of the offence under Section 186 of the IPC by the Court of CJM, Varanasi,
was illegal, as before taking such cognizance it was to be preceded by a complaint in writing by a
public servant as required under Section 195(1) of the CrPC. A written complaint by a public servant
before the court takes cognizance is sine qua non, absence of which would vitiate such cognizance

being taken for any offence punishable under Section 186 of the IPC.
22. This leads us to the next consideration as to whether taking cognizance of the offence under
Section 353 of the IPC by the CJM, Varanasi, was in order or not.
23. For a prohibited act to come within the scope of the offence under Section 353 of the IPC, such
an act must qualify either as an assault or criminal force meant to deter public servant from
discharge of his duty. Obviously, such an act cannot be a mere act of obstruction which is an offence
under Section 186 of the IPC. The offence contemplated under Section 353 of the IPC is of a more
serious nature involving criminal force, or assault which attracts more stringent punishment that
may extend to two years. On the other hand, the offence of obstruction covered under Section 186 of
the IPC is punishable by imprisonment, which may extend to three months at the maximum.
A close examination of Section 353 of the IPC would indicate that to invoke the aforesaid offence,
there must be use of criminal force or assault on any public servant in the execution of his official
duty or with the intent to prevent or deter such public servant from discharging his duty. It would be
clear from a reading of the provisions of Section 186 as well as Section 353 of the IPC that Section
353 of the IPC is the aggravated form of offence where criminal force or assault is involved. Unlike
in the case of Section 186 of the IPC where voluntarily obstructing any public servant in discharge of
his official function is sufficient to invoke the said section, in the case of offence under Section 353
of the IPC as mentioned above, not only obstruction but actual use of criminal force or assault on
the public servant is necessary.
24. In the present case, however, what can be seen from a perusal of the contents of the FIR, is that
no such allegation of assault or use of criminal force has been made. The aforesaid FIR is based on
the complaint filed by the District Probation Officer, which has already been quoted above, and the
same has been reproduced verbatim in the said FIR in which only the allegation of creating
disturbance has been made.
25. In the FIR there is no allegation of use of criminal force or assault by the appellant so as to
invoke the provision of Section 353 of the IPC. It is to be remembered that a criminal process is
initiated only with the lodging of an FIR. Though FIR is not supposed to be an encyclopedia
containing all the detailed facts of the incident and it is merely a document that triggers and sets
into motion the criminal legal process, yet it must disclose the nature of the offence alleged to have
been committed as otherwise, it would be susceptible to being quashed as held in Bhajan Lal’s case
(supra) (vide clause 1 of Para 102 of the decision).
This Court in CBI v. Tapan Kumar Singh, (2003) 6 SCC 175 observed as follows:
“20. It is well settled that a first information report is not an encyclopaedia, which
must disclose all facts and details relating to the offence reported. An informant may
lodge a report about the commission of an offence though he may not know the name
of the victim or his assailant. He may not even know how the occurrence took place.
A first informant need not necessarily be an eyewitness so as to be able to disclose in
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
12
great detail all aspects of the offence committed. What is of significance is that the
information given must disclose the commission of a cognizable offence and the
information so lodged must provide a basis for the police officer to suspect the
commission of a cognizable offence. At this stage it is enough if the police officer on
the basis of the information given suspects the commission of a cognizable offence,
and not that he must be convinced or satisfied that a cognizable offence has been
committed. If he has reasons to suspect, on the basis of information received, that a
cognizable offence may have been committed, he is bound to record the information
and conduct an investigation. At this stage it is also not necessary for him to satisfy
himself about the truthfulness of the information………………………” (emphasis added)
26. However, a perusal of the FIR in issue does not at all indicate the commission of any crime of
use of criminal force or assault by the appellant to the public servant, except for the offence of
obstruction which is punishable under Section 186 of the IPC. As such the ingredients of offence
under Section 353 of the IPC are clearly absent in the FIR. To that extent, we are in agreement with
the appellant that since no ingredient for the offence under Section 353 of the IPC is found in the
FIR, taking cognizance by the CJM of an offence that is not made out in the FIR does not appear to
be correct.
27. The High Court, however, has held that on a perusal of the contents of the FIR and the statement
made by the witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC, it can be said that a prima facie case
has been made out against the appellant for commission of offences under Section 353 and Section
186 of the IPC. It is to be noted that the FIR was filed under Section 353 of the IPC without
mentioning Section 186 of the IPC.
What is to be noted in the present case is that if the appellant had actually used criminal force or had
assaulted the public servants, which would bring the said acts within the scope of Section 353 of the
IPC, nothing prevented the complainant from mentioning the same in the FIR being the first
information. If such vital and crucial facts are missing from the FIR of which the complainant was
fully aware of and was already cognizant of, which he could have mentioned at the first instance, it
would indicate that any subsequent mentioning of these facts in the case by the complainant would
be an afterthought as has happened in the present case. The alleged fact of assault, or use of criminal
force by the appellant could not be said to have been discovered at a later point of time, as these
offensive acts, if really had happened, would have happened before the filing of the FIR/complaint
and thus should have found mention in the FIR. These acts were not something that had happened
at a later point of time, but would have been known to the complainant had these happened when
the complainant and official party were raiding the hostel managed by the appellant. Thus, the
absence of mentioning these alleged acts which would constitute ingredients of the offence under
Section 353 of the IPC, renders the FIR legally untenable as far as the offence under Section 353 of
the IPC is concerned. We do not see any reason why the complainant failed to mention in the FIR
the alleged use of criminal force or assault of the public servants to prevent them from discharging
their official duties when they were raiding the premises.

28. It appears from the impugned order of the High Court that the High Court also perused the
statements of the witnesses recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC during the investigation. We
have also gone through these statements made by Sh. Prabhat Ranjan, District Probation Officer;
Sh. Satyendra Nath Shukla, City Magistrate; Sh. Vindhavasini Rai, Addl. District Magistrate; and Sh.
Surendra Dutt Singh, ACM-IV.
What is interesting to note is that Sri Prabhat Ranjan, the District Probation Officer, Varanasi, who
filed the complaint to the City Magistrate stated in his statement recorded under Section 161 of the
CrPC that the people in the hostel premises attacked the official team, and thereafter, the FIR was
lodged. However, when the FIR was lodged soon after the alleged incident of attack on the officials,
nothing was mentioned in the complaint filed by him about the attack, which was the basis for
registering the FIR, which we are unable to comprehend. If indeed there was an attack as alleged, it
should have found mention in the FIR or the written complaint filed before the City Magistrate soon
after the incident.
29. We have also perused the statement of Sri Satyendra Nath Shukla, the City Magistrate who in his
statement recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC on 20.06.2015, stated that the people in the
hostel premises “were creating obstruction in the government work in the proceeding being carried
out. In such a situation, when asked to submit the records again, the husband, wife and some other
people along with them became aggressive by speaking loudly, due to which, while somehow trying
to escape, around 5:30 pm, the husband, the wife and others created a difficult situation by
obstructing the work, which did not allow the rescue to be completed successfully. After this some
children were rescued by the Women District Program Officer with the help of the District
Horticulture officer, and the children were sent to Ramnagar, after which they were freed. Then
when we asked for the record, Ben John spoke loudly, and his wife and other children got very angry
and seemed to be intent on becoming forceful. After this, the District Probation Officer came to me
with an application regarding obstruction and assault in government work, on which I passed the
order and the SHO Cantt registered a case.” On examination of the said statement of the City
Magistrate, we are of the view that even if the said statement is taken at its face value, it does not
disclose any ingredient of criminal force or assault to make the offence under Section 353 of the IPC,
except for making a bald statement that they were aggressive without disclosing in what manner the
officials were obstructed or attacked.
30. We have also gone through the statement made by Sri Surendra Dutt Singh, ACM, 4th District.
While he mentions that the appellant and others became aggressive and attacked all the officers,
nothing has been mentioned as to how they were attacked, but only a very generalized allegation has
been made without specifics.
Similarly, the other witnesses also stated the same effect.
31. We do not see any reason why the aforesaid alleged assault or attack was not mentioned in the
FIR since soon after the alleged incident happened in the hostel premises, the FIR was lodged. On
the other hand, the written complaint to the City Magistrate only uses the expression of “creating
obstruction” by stating that “Mr. B.N. John, Ms. Susan John and their people are creating
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
14
obstruction in the process of sending the minor children residing in the non-legal institution run by
the Sampoorna Development Trust to other institutions legally. Please take cognizance of this and
take further legal action”.
32. There can be no doubt that there is a sea of difference between “creating disturbance” and the
“assault” and “criminal force” terms mentioned under Section 353 of the IPC and defined under
Sections 350 and 351 of the IPC respectively.
“Criminal force” has been defined under Section 350 IPC, which reads as follows:
“350. Criminal force. —Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that
person's consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of
such force to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will
cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used, is said to use
criminal force to that other.” “Assault” has been defined under Section 351 of the IPC
which reads as follows:
“351. Assault. —Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or
knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present
to apprehend that he who makes that gesture or preparation is about to use criminal
force to that person, is said to commit an assault.
Explanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a
person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make
those gestures or preparations amount to an assault.”
33. If “disturbance” has to be construed as “assault” or “criminal force” without there being specific
acts attributed to make such “disturbance” as “assault” or “criminal face” within the scope of Section
353 of the IPC, it would amount to abuse of the process of law. While “disturbance” could also be
caused by use of criminal force or assault, unless there are specific allegations with specific acts to
that effect, mere allegation of “creating disturbance” cannot mean use of “criminal force” or
“assault” within the scope of Section 353 of the IPC.
34. As noted and discussed above, nothing was mentioned in the complaint/FIR of any specific acts
apart from alleging that the appellant and his party were creating disturbance. Nothing has been
mentioned how disturbance was created because of assault or use of criminal force.
Thus, the contents of the statements recorded later under Section 161 of the CrPC clearly appears to
be an afterthought and the allegation of assault/attack was introduced later on, which is
inconsistent with the contents of the original FIR.
35. Under the circumstances, we are of the view that non mentioning of these vital facts in the
FIR/first complaint, which would indicate assault or criminal force within the scope of Section 353
of the IPC, would vitiate the cognizance taken by the CJM. These vital facts, which constitute the
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
15
ingredients for offence under Section 353 of the IPC, were not revealed in the FIR. On the other
hand, the contents of the FIR would reveal the commission of only non-cognizable offence of
obstructing the discharge of official duties of public servants, which would fall within the scope of
Section 186 of the IPC, in which event, without the order of the Judicial Magistrate, no investigation
could have been launched by the police against the appellant in the said FIR.
It is also to be noted that in the said FIR, Section 186 of the IPC was not even mentioned. We have
already found that no complaint was lodged by a public servant against the appellant and his party
before the Magistrate/court alleging commission of offence under Section 186 of the IPC as required
under Section 195 (1) of the CrPC read with Section 155 of the CrPC. The written complaint filed by
the District Probation Officer was not to a Judicial Magistrate but to an Executive Magistrate, hence
was not valid. The police could not have investigated the said offence under Section 186 of the IPC.
Thus, the very act of taking cognizance at the initial stage by the CJM, Varanasi, on the basis of the
FIR under Section 353 of the IPC, which does not disclose the ingredients and commission of
cognizable offence under Section 353 of the IPC, appears to be contrary to law. If the initial process
is vitiated, the subsequent process would also stand vitiated.
In State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar (2011) 14 SCC 770, it was held as follows:
”107. It is a settled legal proposition that if initial action is not in consonance with
law, all subsequent and consequential proceedings would fall through for the reason
that illegality strikes at the root of the order. In such a fact situation, the legal maxim
sublato fundamento cadit opus meaning thereby that foundation being removed,
structure/work falls, comes into play and applies on all scores in the present case.
108. In Badrinath v. Govt. of T.N. [(2000) 8 SCC 395 : 2001 SCC (L&S) 13 : AIR 2000
SC 3243] and State of Kerala v. Puthenkavu N.S.S. Karayogam [(2001) 10 SCC 191]
this Court observed that once the basis of a proceeding is gone, all consequential acts,
actions, orders would fall to the ground automatically and this principle is applicable
to judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative proceedings equally.”
36. What is evident from the records is that the police entertained the FIR under Section 353 of the
IPC and investigated the same by conferring jurisdiction upon itself as if it was a cognizable offence
as provided under Section 156 of the CrPC, when commission of any cognizable offence was not
made out in the FIR, which is not permissible in law. The police added Section 186 of the IPC later,
and the CJM, Varanasi, took cognizance of the offence of Section 186 of the IPC along with Section
353 of the IPC when no complaint was made by any public servant to the CJM or any court as
required under Section 195 (1) of the CrPC.
37. We are mindful of the position that where, during the investigation of a cognizable or
non-cognizable offence on the basis of an FIR lodged, new facts emerge that will constitute the
commission of a non-cognizable offence under IPC, in which event, the police can continue with the
investigation of the non-cognizable offence of which there cannot be any dispute.
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
16
Thus, even if it is assumed that in the course of the investigation of a cognizable offence, the
ingredients of a non-cognizable offence are discovered then the police could have continued the
investigation without the written complaint to the court or the order of the court in respect of such
non-cognizable offence, as it would also be deemed to be a cognizable offence under Section 155(4)
of the CrPC, but where the investigation of the cognizable office itself suffers from legal infirmity
and without jurisdiction from the initial stage, the entire investigation would be vitiated. For this
reason, the police cannot seek the shield under Section 155 (4) of the CrPC when the FIR did not
disclose the commission of a cognizable offence.
38. As discussed above, the offence allegedly committed by the appellant as disclosed in the FIR can,
at best, be that of a non-cognizable offence under Section 186 of the IPC, though Section 186 of the
IPC is not even mentioned in the FIR. It is evident that Section 186 of the IPC was added
subsequently, of which the CJM took cognizance later. The FIR does indicate that a letter was
written by the District Probation Officer to the City Magistrate, but the said letter pertains to the
filing of the FIR under Section 353 of the IPC and not for offence under Section 186 of the IPC.
Further, the said letter dated 03.06.2015 was not addressed to the CJM, Varanasi, before whom
such a written complaint was supposed to be made to enable the Court to take cognizance of the
offence under Section 186 of the IPC.
39. We have also perused the order dated 13.10.2015 passed by the High Court in the earlier case
filed by Mrs. Susan John, the co-accused, wherein the High Court declined to quash the charge sheet
No. 162 of 2015 dated 20.6.2015 in the same Case Crime No. 290 of 2015 pending before the Court
of CJM, Varanasi, on the ground that perusal of the material on record and looking into the facts of
the case at that stage, it cannot be said that no offence is made out against the applicant, and all the
submissions made at the Bar relate to the disputed questions of fact, which cannot be adjudicated by
the court under Section 482 of the CrPC, and at that stage only the prime facie case is to be seen in
the light of the law laid down by this Court in the cases of R P Kapoor vs. State of Punjab, AIR 1960
SC 866; State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal (supra); State of Bihar vs. PP Sharma, 1992 SCC (Cr) 192;
and Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd. vs. Mohd. Saraful Haq and another, 2005 SCC(Cr) 283.
40. However, it is noticed that the High Court did not examine any of the issues as discussed above
in this appeal. The said decision of the High Court was not interfered with by this Court, and the
SLP filed against the said order dated 13.10.2015 was dismissed in limine by this Court.
This Court has reiterated that in limine dismissal of a Special Leave Petition at the threshold without
giving any detailed reasons does not constitute any declaration of law or a binding precedent under
Article 141 of the Constitution. In State of Punjab vs. Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar (2011) 14 SCC 770,
it was held as follows:
“113. A large number of judicial pronouncements made by this Court leave no manner
of doubt that the dismissal of the special leave petition in limine does not mean that
the reasoning of the judgment of the High Court against which the special leave
petition had been filed before this Court stands affirmed or the judgment and order
impugned merges with such order of this Court on dismissal of the petition. It simply
B.N. John vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 2 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/77064397/
17
means that this Court did not consider the case worth examining for a reason, which
may be other than the merit of the case. An order rejecting the special leave petition
at the threshold without detailed reasons, therefore, does not constitute any
declaration of law or a binding precedent.” We are, thus, of the view that said
decision of the High Court and dismissal in limine by this Court will not come in the
way of disposal of this appeal on merits.
41. Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that taking cognizance by the CJM, Varanasi, of
the offences under Section 353 of the IPC and 186 of the IPC was not done by following the due
process contemplated under the provisions of law, and accordingly, the same being contrary to law,
all the orders passed pursuant thereto cannot be sustained and would warrant interference from this
Court.
42. For the reasons discussed above, we are satisfied that the appellant has been able to make out
the case for quashing the criminal proceedings pending against the appellant before the CJM,
Varanasi.
43. Accordingly, we allow this appeal by quashing Case No. 9790 of 2015 arising out of Case Crime
No. 290 of 2015 under Sections 353 and 186 of the IPC, under P.S. Cantt, District Varanasi, pending
before the Court of the CJM, Varanasi, and the consequent orders passed by the CJM, Varanasi in
taking cognizance and issuing summon to the appellant.
Consequently, the impugned order dated 22.09.2023 passed by the Allahabad High Court in
Application Under Section 482 No. 35311 of 2023 is also set aside.
