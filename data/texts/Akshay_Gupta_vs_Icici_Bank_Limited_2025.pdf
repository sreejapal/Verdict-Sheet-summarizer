                                                 JUDGMENT
VIKRAM NATH, J.
1. This is a classic case where wisdom dawned upon the three parties in a commercial arrangement
to settle the dispute amicably, of course, with a little effort by the Court. The three parties, being the
borrower/flat owners, the builder and the Bank – the lender. Under the agreement between the
parties, there were respective obligations on each of the parties to be fulfilled, in which there were
defaults at the end of each of the parties to some extent. The present appeals have been preferred
under section 23 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 against the common judgment and order
dated 02.01.2023 passed by the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission1 rejecting the
consumer complaints of the appellants (Flat buyers). The relief claimed in the complaints before the
NCDRC was for quashing of the loan recall notice issued by the Bank alleging unfair trade practices

and violation of Reserve Bank of India2 guidelines.
2. We need not mention detailed facts as the same have been appropriately recorded in two orders of
this Court dated 23.10.2024 and 06.11.2024. In the order dated 23.10.2024, broadly, the settlement
had been arrived at, however, instructions were to be taken on certain issues, for which time was
granted. Finally, in NCDRC RBI the order dated 06.11.2024 all the terms of the settlement with
respect to all the four appeals had been recorded. Both the orders as such are reproduced
hereunder: -
“O R D E R (DATED:23.10.2024)
1. Learned senior counsel appearing for the ICICI Bank Ltd. (for short, ‘the Bank’)
has submitted a chart showing the outstanding amount payable by the appellants as
on 16.10.2024. The details of which are as under:
Case No. Outstanding Total Interest Outstanding Total Principal (INR) including

2. Insofar as the appellants in three appeals mentioned in the table are concerned, the appellants
have agreed to settle the outstanding principal amount upfront subject to certain adjustments under
which they would be entitled to benefits from the Bank as also the Builder - Rajsanket Realty Ltd.
(for short, ‘the Builder).
3. Mr. Ritin Rai, learned senior counsel appearing for the Bank, upon instructions, submits that the
Bank would completely waive the outstanding charges and will give a discount of 30% on the
pre-EMI provided the entire outstanding principal amount is settled upfront and the remaining
pre-EMI amount is also paid within any reasonable time granted by this Court.
4. Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the 30% discount, which the Bank has
extended on the pre-EMI amount, should be credited to the benefit of the appellants and as the
Builder has agreed to pay 50% of the pre-EMI amount, the same would be paid by the Builder either
to the appellants and thereafter the appellants may transfer it to the Bank or the Builder may
directly deposit with the Bank subject to directions being issued to the Bank to accept the same from
the Builder in the loan account of the appellants.
5. A further request has been made by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants in Civil
Appeal Nos. 2828 of 2024 and 4336 of 2023 that the appellants have paid certain amount towards
pre-EMI, after the Builder defaulted in making the said payments, and as such the 5% outstanding

amount, which they have to pay to the Builder towards club charges and other balance
consideration, the same may be waived or the Builder may be asked to pay the said amount under
the head of pre-EMI, which the appellants have paid to the Bank.
6. Learned counsel for the Builder upon instructions has agreed to pay 50% of the outstanding
pre-EMI. It is further directed that the learned counsel appearing for the Builder may obtain
instructions as to whether the Builder would prefer to waive the 5% outstanding sale consideration
or get the amount of pre-EMI paid by the appellants to the Bank adjusted against the said 5%
balance sale consideration.
7. In Civil Appeal 1709 of 2023, it is stated that the appellants have already settled the matter with
the Bank and as the Bank has already received its entire settlement amount, it would issue NOC
upon closure of the present pending appeal.
8. Two issues which survive in Civil Appeal No.1709 of 2023 is between the Builder and the
appellants. As, according to the learned counsel for the appellants, the appellants have also paid
certain amount towards pre- EMI against the default of the Builder, and have also paid the
outstanding pre-EMI on the date of the settlement after receiving 30% discount from the Bank, and
would like an adjustment and/or paid by the Builder of both the amounts of pre-EMI against the
balance 5% sale consideration to be paid to the Builder. On this aspect also, learned counsel
appearing for the Builder, shall obtain instructions.
9. Learned counsel appearing for the appellants will provide the details to the Builder about the
pre-EMI amount paid by the appellants to the Bank, within a week from today, so that the Builder
may obtain instructions on the same.
10. Whatever be the outcome of 5% sale consideration and the additional pre-EMI paid by the
appellants, the same will not come in the way of the closure of these appeals and the decision of this
Court will be final and binding on the parties.
11. In the meantime, the appellants will continue with the process and start making the payment to
the Bank towards the outstanding principal amount as also the outstanding pre-EMI amount, which
the Bank, after calculating the interest upto 15.11.2024 and 30.11.2024, intimate to the respective
parties within a week from today.
12. List these matters on 06.11.2024 for consideration of-
(i) whether the amounts have been duly communicated or not;
(ii) clarification on the issue of 5% additional pre-EMI payment between the
appellants and the builder and payment of pre-EMI of the defaulted amount and the
outstanding amount.

1. A detailed order was passed on 23rd October, 2024 granting time to the parties to
provide necessary details and also obtain instructions.
2. Today, ICICI the Bank has produced the chart of the outstanding amount with
respect to Civil Appeal Nos. 1708 of 2023, 4336 of 2023 and 2828 of 2023. The said
chart gives the details of the outstanding amount of the principal and also the

3. Learned counsel appearing for the Builder Shri Viraj Kadam, upon instructions,
has stated that the Builder will pay the outstanding amount of pre-EMI, as
mentioned in the above chart, latest by 20th December, 2024. Further, the learned
counsel for the borrowers-appellants in the above three appeals, upon instruction,
have stated that they will pay the outstanding amount payable by them, as indicated
in the above chart, to the respondent-Bank within a week from the date the Builder
makes the deposit with the Bank, as indicated above.
4. Learned counsel for the Bank has submitted that as the interest is calculated up to
30th November, 2024, the parties may be directed to make the deposit accordingly
on or before the said date or otherwise, the Bank may submit a fresh Chart with
interest calculated up to 31st December, 2024.

5. We are not inclined to accept the request of the Bank considering the fact that the
Builder as also the borrowers-appellants have agreed to clear the entire outstanding
amount, as agreed, including the principal amount. We direct that the Bank would be
entitled to interest up to 30th November, 2024. In case, the Builder or the
borrowers-appellants commit default in not making the payments, as noted above,
the request of the Bank for interest beyond 30th November, 2024 would be
considered.
6. Insofar as the adjustment of the pre-EMI paid by the borrowers-appellants to the
respondent-
Bank, as against the 5% outstanding amount, to be paid by the borrowers-appellants to the Builder
is concerned, Shri Viraj Kadam, learned counsel for the Builder has stated that the Builder will repay
the pre-EMI, paid by the borrowers-appellants to the respective borrowers-appellants, within the
same time i.e. before 20th December, 2024 and the borrowers- appellants may pay the balance 5%
of the sale consideration to the Builder within a week thereafter, as indicated above.
7. Insofar as the appeal of Ravi Agrawal in Civil Appeal No. 1709 of 2023 is concerned, which does
not involve the Bank but only settlement is to be arrived at between the Builder and the
borrower(s)- appellant(s), according to Shri Viraj Kadam learned counsel appearing for the builder
has agreed to pay the 50% of the pre-EMI outstanding amount, which the borrower(s)- appellant(s),
had paid directly to the Bank within the same time i.e. before 20th December 2024. Shri Kadam,
learned counsel further submits that the additional pre-EMI amount prior to the settlement with the
Bank paid by the borrower(s)- appellant(s) will also be paid to the borrower(s)- appellant(s) by the
Builder within the same time whereupon within a week thereafter, the borrower(s)- appellant(s)
may pay the 5% balance of the sale consideration to the Builder. Learned counsel for the
borrower(s)- appellant(s) agrees to the said terms and states that after receiving the additional
pre-EMI amount as also the 50% of the outstanding pre- EMI amount, the borrower(s)-appellant(s)
shall pay the balance 5% of the sale consideration to the Builder within a week.
8. Let the parties comply with the aforesaid terms and conditions and ensure that the timeline is
maintained regarding the payment.
9. It is also directed that the Bank, upon receiving the entire amount, shall issue the NOC to the
Borrowers-appellants forthwith in all the four cases.
10. List these appeals on 8th January, 2025.”
3. When the matter was taken up on 09.01.2025, learned counsel for the parties had informed us
that all the directions contained in order dated 06.11.2024 have been complied with by the parties.
Accordingly, two weeks’ time was granted to the appellants to file the relevant documents relating to
proof of deposits and the No Dues Certificate to be issued by the Bank to enable the Court to pass
the final orders and conclude the proceedings. All the four appellants filed their affidavits before
23.01.2025 when orders were reserved.

4. We have perused the affidavits and we find that full compliance of the terms and conditions
undertaken by the three parties has been done satisfactorily. The Bank had extended the discounts,
the builder had discharged its obligations of payment of its share of pre-EMI and the borrowers had
discharged their obligations by making the deposits with the Bank of the outstanding amount and
also paying to the builder the 5% of the sale consideration which was outstanding.
5. We need not go into the details as the same is an admitted position. The Bank has also issued
certificate stating that nothing further remains. The Bank has no further claim or right whatsoever
against the appellants with respect to the facilities provided for the respective apartments.
6. Only three small issues have been flagged by the appellants, which need further clarification from
this Court:
i) The Bank be directed to remove the word ‘settlement’ used in the loan account
statement as it may affect future loan facilities being availed by the appellant. As
such, the Bank be requested to delete the word ‘settlement’ and substitute it by the
word ‘re-paid’.
ii) The apartments purchased by the appellants are ready and some minor work
remains which the builder may complete forthwith and hand over possession to the
appellants. It is also submitted that builder has already handed over possession in the
said building to many other flat-owners.
iii) Another small issue raised is that the builder has not issued acknowledgment of
the payments made by the appellants pursuant to the order dated 06.11.2024.
7. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and the fact that upfront payment has been
made by the borrower/appellants under orders of this Court, we are of the view that the loan
account should be closed treating it as repaid or fully paid up. Mr. Viraj Kadam, learned counsel
appearing for the builder, upon instruction, stated that the possession would be handed over on or
before 31.03.2025. This takes care of the second issue raised. The third issue raised is only formal.
8. Accordingly, the following directions are issued: -
i) The Bank will accordingly make the necessary incorporations in their records, as
noted above.
ii) As stated by Mr. Kadam, learned counsel for the builder, let possession of the
apartments, fully completed in all respects as required under law, be handed over to
the appellants on or before 31.03.2025.
iii) With respect to the third issue, the amount having been paid by the appellants to the builder by
way of Bank transfer, even if no receipt is issued, the proof of payment is certified by the Bank, but
still, the builder is directed to issue acknowledgment in writing to have received the entire due

amount.
iv) One last thing which remains is that the Bank, which had initiated recovery proceedings before
the Debt Recovery Tribunal or before any other Forum with respect to the loan in question of the
four appellants, shall forthwith withdraw the same, in view of the loan having been satisfied in all
the four cases.
v) Further, appellant Ravi Agrawal or any other appellant who had initiated proceedings before the
Real Estate Regulatory Authority shall withdraw such cases.
9. Thus, all matters between the parties stand closed and there shall be complete quietus to the
litigation. The appeals stand disposed of accordingly.
