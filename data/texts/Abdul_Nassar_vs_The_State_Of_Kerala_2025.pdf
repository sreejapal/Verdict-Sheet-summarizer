CrPC for the continuation of the present appeals to wash off the stigma attached to the accused
appellant and his family which was allowed vide order dated 1st February, 2024.
6. Brief facts relevant and essential for the disposal of these appeals are as follows: -
6.1 The prosecution story in brief is that on 4th April, 2012, at about 6:30 am, the
child victim aged about 9 years was proceeding from her house to the Madrassa
situated at Ponnamkallu in Amarambalam Village. On the way to the Madrassa, she
went to the house of the accused which was situated on the side of the panchayat road
at Ponnamkallu, in search of her friend who is the daughter of the accused so as to go
to the Madrassa together. 6.2 On seeing the child victim all alone, the accused who
was also alone in the house, committed rape upon her in a room in his house at
around 6:45 am, and after that, he strangled the child victim with a shawl and
smothered her with his hands which lead to the death of the victim.
6.3 It is the case of the prosecution that the accused, with the intention to destroy
evidence, concealed the dead body of the victim beneath a cot inside the bedroom in
the said house.
Thereafter, the accused shifted the victim’s dead body to the bathroom attached to the said house.
He also attempted to dispose of the dead body in the septic tank situated at the north-eastern corner
of the house as the stones from under the slab of the septic tank were found removed.
6.4 When the victim could not be found anywhere despite frantic efforts to trace her out, a written
complaint5 came to be submitted by complainant-Salim (PW-1) at the Nilambur Police Station on
4th April, 2012 at 7:00 pm on the basis of which an FIR No. 308 of 5 Exhibit P-1 20126 came to be
registered at the Nilambur Police Station under Section 57 of Kerala Police Act, 2011 and the
investigation was commenced.

adjacent to the house of the accused appellant and thereupon, the offence punishable under Section
57 of the Kerala Police Act, 2011 was altered to Section 302 IPC vide Exhibit P-9. Further, on the
next day, offences punishable under Sections 376 and 201 IPC and Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice
(Care and Protection) Act, 20007 were also added to FIR No. 308 of 20128 vide Exhibit P-20, and
the investigation continued. The accused appellant was arrested on 6th April, 2012. 6.6 The
Investigating Officer (PW-24) forwarded a report9 regarding the addition of the name and address
of the accused in the aforesaid FIR. Material forensic evidence was collected from the crime scene
and was subjected to scientific examination. Incriminating recoveries were effected in furtherance of
the disclosure statements made by the appellant. After the conclusion of the investigation, a charge
sheet came to be filed against the 6 Exhibit P-11 7 Hereinafter being referred to as ‘JJ Act’ 8 Supra,

8. The accused upon being questioned under Section 313 CrPC denied the prosecution allegations
but chose not to lead any evidence in defence. The trial Court proceeded to convict and sentence the
accused in the above terms10 vide judgment dated 31st July 2013.
9. Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial Court, the accused appellant
preferred Criminal Appeal No. 1452 of 2013 under Section 374(2) CrPC before the High Court of
Kerala at Ernakulam. Since, the trial Court awarded death sentence to the accused for the offence
punishable under Section 302 IPC, the matter was referred to the High Court for confirmation of the
death sentence under Section 366 CrPC vide D.S.R. No. 3 of 2013.
10 Refer, Para 2
10. Criminal Appeal No. 1452 of 2013 and D.S.R. No. 3 of 2013 were decided vide common judgment
dated 28th February 2018, whereby the Division Bench of the High Court dismissed the Criminal
Appeal and allowed the Death Sentence Reference confirming the death sentence awarded to the
accused appellant. The said judgment is assailed in the present appeals. Submissions on behalf of
the appellant:
11. Shri Trideep Pais, learned senior counsel representing the accused appellant advanced the
following pertinent submissions to assail the impugned judgment: -
11.1 That the prosecution has not been able to establish that the body of the victim
girl was dumped in the bathroom by the accused. The bathroom where the body was
found was located outside the house of the accused and was open and easily
accessible to all and sundry. The accused was not in the house at the time of the
incident and thus, the possibility of someone else having committed the crime cannot
be ruled out. 11.2 That the body of the deceased was discovered at around 7:30 pm
and the police officials arrived at the scene for the first time at around 9:00 pm i.e.
after a delay of 1.5 hours. Admittedly, local people arrived at the crime scene during
this time and thus, the possibility of the public tampering with the body of the
deceased and disturbing and contaminating the crime scene cannot be ruled out
which brings the integrity of samples collected during the investigation under a
shadow of doubt. 11.3 That the scene of occurrence and body of the deceased
remained unsealed and unguarded for around 14 hours until 9:00 am of 5th April,
2012, i.e., the time when inquest was prepared.
Abdul Nassar vs The State Of Kerala on 7 January, 2025

This renders every subsequent seizure of samples or evidence collected from the house of the
accused or the body of the deceased unreliable with a strong possibility of degradation and
contamination of body and so also the tampering of evidence. 11.4 That as per the statement of AP
Chandran, Investigating Officer (PW-24), the underwear was found on the body of the deceased
while as per the Inquest Report11, the underwear (MO 11) was found in the kitchen. Further, none of
the witnesses to the inquest report were examined and also the contents of the inquest report have
not been proved by the Investigating Officer (PW-24) in his deposition.
11.5 That the blood stains were only found in the north-west room which is admittedly not the room
where the crime was committed 11 Exhibit P-19 and there is no tangible evidence on record to
explain how the dead body was taken unnoticed from the crime scene to the bathroom situated
outside the house of the accused.
11.6 That no seizure memo was prepared for the collection of the clothes of the deceased i.e. midi
skirt, petticoat, top and underwear seized by the Investigating Officer (PW-24) and even the inquest
report12 does not mention that these items were sealed. 11.7 That the chain of custody of all articles
seized by the police has not been established and there has been a lapse in sending the material
articles for forensic examination. Also, the manner of storage of the biological samples has been
improper which is contrary to the mandate laid down by this Court in Rahul v. State (NCT of
Delhi)13 and Prakash Nishad @ Kewat Zinak Nishad v. State of Maharashtra14.
11.8 That the findings of the DNA Report15 dated 11th January, 2024 and FSL Report16 of seminal
stains, blood and hair dated 4th January, 2024 cannot be relied upon due to the absence of
corroborative evidence of seizure and reasons behind the findings of the experts. Thus, these reports
do not meet the standards of 12 Exhibit P-19 13 (2023) 1 SCC 83 14 2023 SCC OnLine SC 666 15
Exhibit P-14 16 Exhibit P-13 expert evidence enumerated under Section 45 of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872.
11.9 That it is a settled position of law that the accused must be given an opportunity to explain all
evidence against him during the recording of his statement under Section 313 CrPC which has not
been complied with in the instant case inasmuch as the findings of DNA examination and
serological examination were not put to the accused and thus, the same cannot be relied upon in
support of the prosecution case.
11.10 That the disclosure statement17 made by the accused cannot be relied upon as the exclusive
knowledge or access of the accused to the terrace from which the alleged recovery was made is not
shown by the prosecution and the recovered articles were not identified in TIP18 or adequately link
with the deceased. 11.11 That the material witness, Amina Thana who had last seen the deceased
going towards the Madrassa, and other witnesses namely, Muhammad Shan, Kunhiappa, and
Keshavan who were part of the search party were not examined by the prosecution. 11.12 That the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses, Nazarudheen (PW-2), Shamsudheen (PW-8) and
Unnikrishnan 17 Exhibit P-23 18 Test Identification Parade (PW-12) cannot be relied upon.
Nazarudheen (PW-2) stated that he went to the house of the accused on four occasions, and it was
during his fourth visit, he found the dead body of the victim in the bathroom. It was contended that

Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54066237/
6
PW-2 had even searched the bathroom on his third visit but did not find anything and thus
apparently, the recovery of the dead body is a planted one. 11.13 That there is no eyewitness to the
alleged incident and the case of the prosecution hinges entirely on circumstantial evidence. The
prosecution has failed to prove the complete chain of incriminating circumstances pointing towards
the guilt of the accused. In this regard, learned senior counsel relied upon the judgments of this
Court in Hanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh19; Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v. State of
Maharashtra20 to submit that it is settled law that in a case of circumstantial evidence, the chain of
circumstances must be so complete that it is consistent only with the guilt of accused and every
other possible hypothesis is excluded. 11.14 That the instant case does not fall within the purview of
the rarest of rare cases. The High Court affirmed the death sentence awarded to the accused without
adverting to the relevant 19 (1952) 2 SCC 71 20 (1984) 4 SCC 116 mitigating and aggravating
circumstances pertaining to the accused.
He thus implored the Court to accept the appeals and set aside the impugned judgments.
Submissions on behalf of Respondent-State: -
12. Per contra, Shri R. Basant, learned senior counsel representing the State,
vehemently and fervently opposed the submissions advanced by the learned senior
counsel for the accused appellant and submitted that every reasonable hypothesis
points towards the guilt of the accused. He urged that two Courts, i.e., the trial Court
as well as the High Court, have recorded concurrent findings of facts, convicting the
accused and hence, this Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 136 of
the Constitution of India should be slow to interfere with such concurrent findings of
facts. He advanced the following submissions while supporting the impugned
judgment and imploring the Court to dismiss the appeals: -
12.1 That the blood stains were found inside the house of the accused, beneath the cot
and on the cot, and the DNA Report21 establishing that the blood stains found were
that of the deceased.
21 Exhibit P-14 12.2 That the seminal stains on the vaginal swab and smear of the deceased collected
by Forensic Surgeon (PW22) also matched with the DNA of the accused as per the DNA Report
(Exhibit P-14). 12.3 That the Inquest Report (Exhibit P-19) is an admissible piece of evidence since
the same was prepared by the Investigation Officer (PW-24) while discharging his official duties
under Section 174 CrPC. In this regard, the learned counsel placed reliance on Rameshwar Dayal
and Others v. State of U.P.22 and George and Others v. State of Kerala and Another23 12.4 That no
explanation has been given by the accused for recovery of the writing pad (MO3), pen (MO4), plastic
cover (MO5), plastic carry bag (MO6) and the underwear of the victim (MO11) from the roof of his
own house.
12.5 That the learned counsel for the appellant contended that Nazarudheen (PW2) went to the
house of the accused four times on the date of the incident i.e. 4th April, 2012. The body of the
deceased was found by him on the fourth visit, and PW2 had even searched the bathroom on his
Abdul Nassar vs The State Of Kerala on 7 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54066237/
7
third visit but did not find anything. However, he submitted that it is clear from the evidence of
Nazarudheen (PW2) that he had a grave suspicion against the 22 (1978) 2 SCC 518 23 (1998) 4 SCC
605 accused, and he informed this fact to Shamsudheen (PW8) and Unnikrishnan (PW12). The
accused became apprehensive after the third visit of Nazarudheen (PW2) and thus, he told PW2 that
he did not have the key to his house. In the meantime, he shifted the body from the bedroom to the
bathroom in an attempt to hide the dead body in the septic tank.
12.6 That the instant case falls within the rarest of rare cases as the accused was in a relationship of
trust, belief, and confidence with the deceased, being the father of a friend of the deceased and there
are no extenuating circumstances which can be said to mitigate the enormity of the crime.
On these submissions, Mr. Basant implored the Court to dismiss the appeals and affirm the
impugned judgement. Discussion and Conclusion: -
13. We have given our thoughtful consideration to the submissions advanced at bar and have gone
through the judgments of the trial Court and High Court as well as the evidence available on record.
14. Indisputably, the prosecution case rests on circumstantial evidence. The law with regard to a
case based purely on circumstantial evidence has very well been crystalized in the judgment of this
Court in the case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda(supra), wherein this Court held thus:
“152. Before discussing the cases relied upon by the High Court we would like to cite a
few decisions on the nature, character and essential proof required in a criminal case
which rests on circumstantial evidence alone. The most fundamental and basic
decision of this Court is Hanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh [(1952) 2 SCC 71: AIR
1952 SC 343: 1952 SCR 1091: 1953 Cri LJ 129]. This case has been uniformly followed
and applied by this Court in a large number of later decisions up to date, for instance,
the cases of Tufail (Alias) Simmi v. State of Uttar Pradesh [(1969) 3 SCC 198: 1970
SCC (Cri) 55] and Ramgopal v. State of Maharashtra [(1972) 4 SCC 625: AIR 1972 SC
656]. It may be useful to extract what Mahajan, J. has laid down in Hanumant case
[(1952) 2 SCC 71: AIR 1952 SC 343: 1952 SCR 1091: 1953 Cri LJ 129]:
“It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,
the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first
instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only
with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. Again, the circumstances should be of
a conclusive nature and tendency, and they should be such as to exclude every
hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. In other words, there must be a chain
of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion
consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that
within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.”
153. A close analysis of this decision would show that the following conditions must
be fulfilled before a case against an accused can be said to be fully established:
Abdul Nassar vs The State Of Kerala on 7 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54066237/

(1) The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be
fully established.
It may be noted here that this Court indicated that the circumstances concerned “must or should”
and not “may be” established. There is not only a grammatical but a legal distinction between “may
be proved” and “must be or should be proved” as was held by this Court in Shivaji Sahabrao Bobade
v. State of Maharashtra [(1973) 2 SCC 793 : 1973 SCC (Cri) 1033 : 1973 Crl LJ 1783] where the
observations were made: [SCC para 19, p. 807: SCC (Cri) p. 1047] “Certainly, it is a primary
principle that the accused must be and not merely may be guilty before a court can convict and the
mental distance between ‘may be’ and ‘must be’ is long and divides vague conjectures from sure
conclusions.” (2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of
the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesis except that the
accused is guilty, (3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, (4) they
should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved, and (5) there must be a chain
of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the
innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done
by the accused.
154. These five golden principles, if we may say so, constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case
based on circumstantial evidence.”
15. In the light of these guiding principles, we will have to examine the facts of the present case.
16. Before delving into the discussion with respect to the submission regarding the breach in the link
evidence on which the entire focus was laid by the learned senior counsel for the appellant, we
would like to discuss the other important pieces of evidence on which the trial Court as well as the
High Court relied upon so as to record and uphold the conviction recorded against the accused
appellant.
17. The High Court primarily relied upon the deposition of maternal uncle of the deceased child
namely, Saleem(PW-1), another maternal uncle of the deceased child namely, Nazarudheen (PW-2),
mother of the deceased, Suhara (PW-9), and the Madrassa teacher, Ibrahim Darimi (PW-10). The
summary of the evidence of these witnesses can be extracted from paragraphs 8 to 11 of the
impugned judgment rendered by the High Court which is reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of
convenience:-
“8. PW1 is the uncle (mother's brother) of the deceased. He gave Fl statement
regarding the fact that the girl was missing from their house. Ext.P1 is the FI
statement given at 7.00 p.m. on 4/4/2012. In the statement, he has stated that she
had gone to the madrassa at about 7 am on 4/4/2012. Since she did not come back by
about 10 am, he had gone and enquired at the Madrassa, and he was told that she had
not reached there. When enquired with the people in the locality, they told that she
was seen within 100 meters of the madrassa. They went and checked up in the
locality and the house of relatives where she would normally go. Since no information

was received, a complaint was filed.
9. PW9 is the mother of the deceased child., She deposed that the victim was studying in the 3rd
standard in Government L.P. School at Kavalamukkatta in 2012. The birth certificate had been
produced by the Headmaster of the School PW5 and marked as Ext.P3. In Ext.P3, her date of birth
was shown as 25/8/2002.
10. PW10, the teacher in the madrassa deposed that she was studying in the 3rd standard and
normally she comes at 7.00 a.m. and the class will be over by 9.00 a.m. On 4/4/2012, there was an
examination, but she did not come.
11. PW2 is another uncle (mother's brother), of the deceased. He deposed that while conducting
search for the minor girl, he got information from a lady by name Amina that she saw her
granddaughter and the victim going together in the direction of madrassa. When he enquired in the
madrassa, he was informed that she did not reach there. The house of the accused is very near to the
madrassa. PW2 conducted a search near the house of the accused also. The house of the accused was
found locked. During a second search, PW2 again reached near the house of the accused by around
4.00 p.m. Even at that time, the house was found locked. By about 6.45 p.m., he along with certain
other persons reached near the house of the accused. The accused was found sitting on the veranda.
When they asked the accused about the girl, he told them that he also went in search for her, and he
reached the house only at that time PW2 also searched the shed and the bathroom of the said house.
He asked the accused to open the house in order to conduct a search. Accused told him that the key
was with his wife and that he would go and bring it. PW2 therefore went to search in the pond which
was situated near the house of the accused. He again went near the madrassa where he met a few
other persons including PW8. However, PW2 had some suspicion regarding the accused which he
communicated to them. They therefore came to the house of the accused. They found the house of
the accused locked. PW12 had a torch with him. He went to the bathroom and found a heap of
clothes. He called others. PW8 entered the bathroom and removed the clothes and found the dead
body of the girl lying beneath the clothes. They shouted for the people in the locality. Many people
gathered and the police also had come, PW8 and PW12 who were also along with PW2 had
supported the above version.”
18. Neither there is any doubt, nor any argument was raised by the learned counsel for the appellant
that any of these witnesses bore an animus against the accused so as to influence them for deposing
falsely against the accused. All these witnesses are either related to the victim or were residents of
the neighbourhood who could not have entertained any motive for falsely implicating the accused
and that too, for such a heinous offence. The evidence of these witnesses portrays the following
sequence of the events: -
18.1 The child victim had proceeded from the house for going to the Madrassa at 6:30
am on 4th April, 2012. She did not reach the Madrasa on which a search was started.
18.2 Since the last location of the child victim was found near the house of the
accused, Nazarudheen (PW-2) [the maternal uncle of the deceased] conducted the

10
search near his house which was found locked.
18.3 The search proceedings continued and Nazarudheen (PW-2) again reached near
the house of the accused at around 4:00 pm. Even at that time, the house of the
accused was locked. 18.4 At around 6:45 pm, Nazarudheen (PW-2) accompanied with
certain other persons reached near the house of the accused and the accused was
found sitting in the veranda of the house. 18.5 On inquiry being made from the
accused about the girl, he replied that he had also gone for search of the child and
had reached back to his house only at that time. 18.6 Nazarudheen (PW-2) also
searched the shed and the bathroom of the house of the accused. He asked the
accused to open the house in order to conduct a search. The accused told him that the
key was with his wife, and he would go to fetch it. 18.7 Nazarudheen (PW-2) went to
search in the pond which was situated near the house of the accused. He again went
near the Madrassa where he met few other members of the search party including
Shamsudheen (PW-8).
18.8 The conduct of the accused raised suspicion upon which Nazarudheen (PW-2)
along with the other members of the search party [Shamsudheen(PW-8) and
Unnikrishnan(PW-12)] came back to the house of the accused which was still locked.
18.9 Unnikrishnan (PW-12) had a torch with him. He lighted the torch and went to
the bathroom and in illumination thereof, he found a heap of clothes. He called the
other members of the search party. Shamsudheen (PW-8) entered the bathroom and
removed the clothes and found the dead body of the child victim lying beneath the
clothes.
18.10 A hue and cry was raised, and many people gathered there.
The parents of the deceased child were also called. 18.11 The people of the locality caught hold of the
accused and he was taken to the hospital where certain injuries were noted on his body.
Shamsudheen (PW-8) and Unnikrishnan (PW-12) also fully supported the version of Nazarudheen
(PW-2) in their depositions. 18.12 The dead body of the deceased child was subjected to postmortem
at the hands of Dr. P.A. Sheeju (PW-22) who took note of a total of 37 ante-mortem injuries in the
postmortem report24. The doctor opined that the victim died due to manual compressive and
ligature constrictive strangulation. The injuries on the body and external genitalia were suggestive of
forcible vaginal penetrative sex.
19. A holistic view of the evidence of Nazarudheen (PW-2), Shamsudheen (PW-8) and Unnikrishnan
(PW-12) would show that their initial attempts to search the house of the accused did not succeed
because the same was found to be locked. At that time, these witnesses had also checked inside the
bathroom which is just adjacent to the house of the accused. The accused has not denied that this
bathroom was a part and parcel of his property.
20. When the initial search of the bathroom was taken, nothing was seen therein. Immediately
thereafter, the accused posed to the search party that the key to the lock of his house was with his

wife. There was an intervening gap in these two events. After some interregnum, when the witnesses
Nazarudheen (PW-2), Shamsudheen (PW-8) and Unnikrishnan (PW-12) went into the 24 Exhibit
P-15 bathroom of the accused, they found the dead body of the child lying there. It shows that when
the witnesses kept on persevering to search the house of the accused, he tried to parry their
attempts. Taking advantage of the gap wherein the witnesses had gone to the Madrassa, he shifted
the dead body from inside of the house to the bathroom and that is why the dead body was found
lying in the bathroom on second search being made.
21. The Investigating Officer (PW-24) apprehended the accused and arrested him. At the time of
arrest, the accused was found having injuries which appear to have been caused by the local people
before his arrest.
22. The Investigating Officer (PW-24) interrogated the accused and recorded his disclosure
statement25 and acting in furtherance thereof, the school bag containing the writing pad and
footwear etc. of the victim were recovered. These articles were identified by Suhara(PW-9), the
mother of deceased.
23. The summary of the scientific evidence and the carrying of the samples by the police officials for
forensic examination are contained in paragraph 13 of the impugned judgment rendered by 25
Exhibit P-23 the High Court and the same is being reproduced hereinbelow for the sake of ready
reference:-
“13. The investigating officer had also taken steps for conducting scientific evidence
by sending about 16 sealed packets to the Forensic Science Laboratory, PW20 had
conducted the examination of seminal stain on item Nos.1 to 5, 12 and 13(a) and the
same was detected in all those items. The items were a midi skirt M07, a dhoti MO14,
a towel and vaginal swab. Blood was also detected on the midi skirt, petticoat, dhoti,
a full sleeve shirt, cotton gauze etc. The blood was found to be of human origin.
Further, nail cuttings were also examined by PW20. But no foreign tissues were
detected.
Various other items were sent by PW20 for DNA analysis. Pw21 has conducted a DNA analysis. DNA
typing showed that the seminal stains in item Nos. l and 13(a) belonged to the accused. Item No.1 is
the midi skirt and item No. 13(a) is the vaginal swab. Item No.16 was the blood sample taken from
the accused. It is further reported that the DNA typing showed that the blood stains in items Nos, 5
and 6 and the cells on the nail cuttings in item Nos.17(a) and 17(b) belonged to the accused. Item
No.5 is the reddish brown coloured torn single dhoti and item No.6 is the green coloured torn and
soiled full sleeve shirt with self- lines. Further DNA typing shows that item Nos.1, 7, 8 and 12 and
vaginal cells in item No:13(a) belonged to the deceased. Item No.7 is the blood stain collected in
cotton gauze from the floor beneath the cot and item No.8 is the blood stain collected in the cotton
gauze from the cot. Ext.P14 is the report prepared by PW21.”
24. Though learned counsel for the appellant has vehemently and fervently criticised the link
evidence, but after going through the testimony of the Investigating Officer (PW-24), DNA expert

12
(PW-4) Constable Nisha (PW-16) and on an overall appreciation of the evidence of the witnesses
mentioned above, we find that the prosecution has given convincing link evidence to establish the
safe keeping of the samples right from the time of the seizure till receipt at the forensic laboratory.
The accused himself has not claimed that after his arrest, the Investigating Officer (PW-24) tried to
collect his sample of the semen. Thus, there was no possibility that the semen containing the DNA of
the accused could have been planted on the body of the deceased.
25. The following circumstances stand firmly established from a threadbare analysis of the evidence
available on record, pointing towards the guilt of the accused appellant: -
(i) The child victim was a friend of the daughter of the accused, and they used to go to
Madrassa together.
(ii) On the date of incident, the child victim was seen with the daughter of the
accused. However, she never reached Madrassa.
(iii) When the child victim did not return home, an extensive search was conducted
and since, the child victim was last seen with the daughter of the accused, the needle
of suspicion pointed towards the house of the accused, more particularly because his
house was situated close by the Madrassa.
(iv) Nazarudheen (PW-2) tried to repeatedly search the house of the accused along
with neighbours and in the efforts to trace out the child victim, the witness found the
house of the accused locked in his first and second attempts.
(v) During the third search attempt, the witness(PW-2) found the accused sitting in
verandah of his house. Upon being asked for the permission to search his house, the
accused stated that the keys of the house were with his wife, and he would bring it
himself.
(vi) The witness Nazarudheen (PW-2) during the third attempt, searched the
slopping shed and the bathroom adjacent to the house but to no avail whereafter, he
went to search the pond near the house of the accused.
(vii) After searching the pond, the witness(PW-2) fixed the battery of the torch which
he had called from his father, since it was dark and reached near the Madrassa.
(viii) In the fourth attempt, witnesses namely, Nazarudheen (PW-2), Shamsudheen
(PW-8) and Unnikrishnan (PW-12) got suspicious of the accused’s conduct and
resumed the search of the house of the accused and even this time, the house of the
accused was locked, and the accused was not present there. PW-12 inspected the
bathroom by lighting his torch and found a heap of clothes, which was removed by
PW-8 and the dead body of the child victim was discovered concealed thereunder.

(viii) Two stones of the septic tank inside the house of the accused were also found
moved.
(ix) Blood-stained pink colour midiskirt (MO-7), petticoat (MO-8) and black miditop
(MO-9) worn by the deceased child victim were identified by her mother(PW-9),
recovered by the police officials from the house of the accused and were seized. An
underwear(MO11) of the deceased was also found in the kitchen of the house of the
accused.
(x) Blood stains were found on the cot and floor beneath it.
(xi) As per the postmortem report26, a total of 37 ante mortem injuries were found
on the child victim’s body along with injuries on the genitalia, suggestive of forcible
penetrative sexual assault.
The cause of death was opined to be manual compressive and ligature constrictive strangulation.
(xii) As per the FSL report27, the midiskirt worn by child victim, the dhoti of the accused and cotton
gauze collected from the scene of crime contained human spermatozoa and semen. The hair
collected from the crime scene matched with the hair of the deceased child victim.
(xiii) The DNA report28 clearly proved that the DNA profile of the semen stains found on the
midiskirt (MO-7) matched with that of 26 Exhibit P-15 27 Exhibit P-13 28 Exhibit P-14 the accused.
Further, the blood stains found on the cot and beneath it were that of the deceased child victim.
(xiv) The slippers, hard-board writing pad, plastic cover of the writing pad, grey coloured pen and
light rose small plastic carry bag belonging to the deceased child victim, as identified by her mother
(PW-9), were recovered in furtherance of the voluntary disclosure statement29 of the accused.
26. Based on the analysis of the evidence on the record, we are of the view that the chain of
incriminating circumstances required to bring home the guilt of the accused is complete in all
aspects. In the present case, we affirm that the prosecution has been able to prove the guilt of the
accused appellant by fulfilling the five golden principles (Panchsheel) laid down by this Court in the
case of Sharad Birdhichand Sarda(supra) and that the circumstances present before us, taken
together establish conclusively only one hypothesis that being the guilt of the accused appellant.
27. In the wake of the discussion made hereinabove, there is no doubt in the mind of the Court that
the prosecution has proved by leading clinching and convincing circumstantial evidence that the 29
Exhibit P-23 accused had committed forcible and violent sexual assault on the child victim and,
thereafter, strangled and killed her.
28. While we concur with the ultimate conclusions reached by the learned trial Court and the High
Court, we cannot overlook the deficiencies in the methodology adopted by both the Courts in the
appraisal and analysis of the circumstantial evidence. The manner in which the evidence has been
Abdul Nassar vs The State Of Kerala on 7 January, 2025
Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/54066237/
14
scrutinized lacks the depth and rigor expected, raising concerns about the adequacy of the evaluative
process undertaken to arrive at the said decisions.
29. The Courts have undertaken an examination of the testimonies of the witnesses but has omitted
to delineate the inferences derivable therefrom. Moreover, they failed to expound upon how the
prosecution has succeeded in constructing an unbroken chain of circumstances that irrefutably
establishes the culpability of the accused to the exclusion of any other hypothesis.
30. We deem it essential to enunciate the principles that courts must adhere to while appreciating
and evaluating evidence in cases based on circumstantial evidence, as follows:
(i). The testimony of each prosecution and defence witness must be meticulously
discussed and analysed. Each witness's evidence should be assessed in its entirety to
ensure no material aspect is overlooked.
(ii). Circumstantial evidence is evidence that relies on an inference to connect it to a
conclusion of fact. Thus, the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the
testimony of each witness must be explicitly delineated.
(iii). Each of the links of incriminating circumstantial evidence should be
meticulously examined so as to find out if each one of the circumstances is proved
individually and whether collectively taken, they forge an unbroken chain consistent
only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with his
innocence.
(iv). The judgment must comprehensively elucidate the rationale for accepting or
rejecting specific pieces of evidence, demonstrating how the conclusion was logically
derived from the evidence. It should explicitly articulate how each piece of evidence
contributes to the overall narrative of guilt.
(v). The judgment must reflect that the finding of guilt, if any, has been reached after
a proper and careful evaluation of circumstances in order to determine whether they
are compatible with any other reasonable hypothesis.
31. Consequently, the appeals lack merit and are hereby dismissed. However, the question of
execution of death sentence awarded to the appellant has been rendered otiose, considering the fact
that he has passed away. Thus, there remains no question of dealing with the aspect of capital
punishment awarded to the appellant(since deceased).
32. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
