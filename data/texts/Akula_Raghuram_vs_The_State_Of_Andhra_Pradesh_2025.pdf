K. VINOD CHANDRAN, J.
The appeal arises from the order of the Revisional Court which confirmed the conviction and
sentence of the accused/appellant under Section 366-A of the Indian Penal Code, 18601 as handed
over by the Trial Court and confirmed by the Appellate Court.
1 “IPC”
2. Mr. Abhijit Basu, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant pointed out that the
conviction under Section 366-A is totally misconceived since none of the ingredients under the
provision are attracted in the above case. The allegation is one that the appellant having taken away
the victim with an intention of marrying her. There is absolutely no allegation of any sexual advance
having been made against the victim by the accused or any third party. The fact remains that victim
who was a major, had roamed around for about two months and returned home to raise the
allegation against the appellant. There are gross inconsistencies in the evidence of the victim and
her parents as to the cause leading to the alleged abduction; which makes the story completely
unbelievable. Neither has the appellant induced the victim nor was there any likelihood of she being
forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with any other person. The victim was not proved to be a

minor girl and the courts below have erred aggregately in convicting the appellant. Ms. Prerna
Singh, learned standing counsel appearing for the respondent-State, vigorously, opposed the
contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant. The expert evidence proved beyond
doubt that the girl was a minor and there is no question of consent arises. The fact that the accused
had taken her from the lawful custody of her parents was proved beyond doubt. The desire of a
marriage with the victim, as entertained by the accused brings in a likelihood of sexual intercourse
which in the context of the age of the victim attracts the offence. The Courts below have convicted
the accused on valid evidence.
3. We have given anxious consideration to the evidence recorded, especially since it has been found
to be proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused has committed the offence charged. We have
to immediately notice that there is absolutely no allegation of any sexual act having been committed
against the victim nor even a sexual advance made. The victim also does not speak of any
apprehension of a likelihood of an illicit intercourse being thrust upon her by either the appellant or
any other person.
4. In the trial, eleven witnesses were examined as PWs 1 to 11 and the nine exhibits marked included
the portions of the statements made under Sections 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973 2. The material object, namely; the white coloured tracks jeep was also produced before the
Court.
5. On the allegations, suffice it to notice that the appellant is said to have forced the victim into a
jeep on 03.05.2001, after having developed a friendly relationship with the family of the victim and
taken her to three different locations inside the State. The abduction was alleged to be since that
appellant had a desire to marry the victim. At the last location, the victim escaped and came back to
her father after which the First Information Report3 was registered on information given by the
victim to the police; when the father took her to the police station.
6. PWs 1 and 2 are the parents and PW 7 is the victim, the alleged minor child. PWs 1, 2 and 7 spoke
of a close relationship with the appellant; whose marriage they had attended and PW 8 deposed that
she along with her brother had visited the accused and his family and stayed at their residence with
the consent of her parents. Strangely, the 2“Cr.P.C.” 3 “F.I.R.” allegation levelled was there before
the marriage of the appellant, he had sought the hand of PW 7; which was denied by her family. We
cannot but notice that as per the evidence, the friendly relationship between the families continued
even after the marriage and the allegation is that despite the appellant being married, he took away
the victim, PW 7, with a desire to get married with her. The story spoken out by the witnesses
smacks of disbelief.
7. PW 3 is an eye-witness who is said to have seen the abduction or rather, the victim being taken
away in the jeep. PW 3 is an acquaintance of the family of the victim and he is a resident of a place
which the victim is allowed to have been kidnapped. This version is that on 03.05.2001 when he was
sitting in front of his house, he saw the victim passing- by with a basket of bananas. Fifteen minutes
later, he saw passed a white coloured trax jeep moving in the direction in which the victim had gone
and one and a half an hour later saw her going in the opposite direction, sitting inside the jeep. He

also deposed that apart from the victim, the jeep only had the driver inside it. PW 3 did not identify
the appellant and strangely enough, he was not asked even to identify the jeep which was seized and
produced before the Court as M.O.1. In this context, it has to be stated that PW 3 did not speak of
the registration number of the jeep nor was the registration certificate of the jeep produced or even
the seizure mahazar proved before the Court.
8. PW 6 and 8 turned hostile. Of these, PW 8 was a tractor mechanic and he deposed that he had a
shop at Mandanapalle town. Previously, he was examined to prove the seizure of the vehicle but
even after he was declared hostile. No question was specifically put to him as to the seizure Mahazar
and he denied since only exhibit P-6 portion of his 161 Cr.P.C. statement was confirmed by him.
Exhibit P-6 statement made by PW 8 was confirmed by the Investigating Officer 4 however, the
seizure was carried out under exhibit P-9 as spoken out by the I.O. was never confirmed to PW 8.
The jeep was said to be produced before the Court by the owner; whose identify is not proved and
hence, there is absolutely no way to connect the appellant/accused with the jeep and the identify of
4 “I.O.” the driver of the jeep having not been established who is said to have abducted the victim.
9. PW 7 has been examined whose evidence is crucial insofar as the victims testimony having
established specially status in law, especially when it has a ring of truth. PW 7 after speaking of the
earlier relationship of the two families, deposed that she went to Ramanaiahgaripalle to sell bananas
and after selling the same, she was returning at about 11:00 A.M. the accused came there in a jeep
and asked her to board it. The accused coaxed her and then pulled her into the jeep forcibly and
when the victim questioned him, he threatened her with death. She was taken to Madanapalle in the
jeep where she left on the road while parking the jeep in a mechanic shed . Here, we pause to
observe that neither was the location of the abduction visited and the details used in the seizure
mahazar prepared of the shed from which the vehicle was seized. We say this specifically since the
abduction presumably took place from a public road and the victim herself claims that she was left
on the road, while the accused parked the jeep; when she did not attempt to run away.
10. Be that as it may, PW 7 continues to say that she was taken to RTC bus stand by the appellant
from where they boarded in a bus to Bangalore. It was at this point that again she questioned the
appellant of his intentions when he disclosed his desire to marry her. Strangely enough, even as per
PW 7, she only resisted the proposal by reason of her desire to continue her studies. Obviously, from
the earlier part of PW 7’s deposition, she was aware that the appellant was married, and she did not
object to the proposal of that count which seriously puts to peril her version especially the factum of
the appellant having forced her to proceed with him. PW 7 concludes by saying that she escaped
from the clutches of the appellant at Vijayawada and returned to her home on 09.07.2001 where her
father first took her to the police station who later sent her to the doctor for examination and the
Magistrate who recorded exhibit P-5 statement under Section 162of the Cr.P.C. She reiterated that
the accused threatened to kill her, kept her from communicating with any other person, confined
her in his presence and projected intention was also a marriage with the victim.
11. Strangely, in the cross-examination, PW 7 turned turtle and stated that earlier to the alleged
incident, she did not talk to the accused and she did not had any previous acquaintance with the
accused. On a specific question asked with regard to her stay in the house of the accused, her answer

was also that she does not remember the exact date. She admitted that when she was travelling with
the accused, she did not at any time created a hue and cry so as to escape from the accused. She also
did not specify the places where she was confined at Bangalore, Vizag and Vijayawada. Her version
about her escape was also that she came in a train, the details which she was unaware of, by taking
to the Ticket Collector without taking a ticket and reached her home on 09.07.2001. She does not
speak about the station at which she had de-boarded the train but claimed that she travelled her
village from Tirupati in a bus. In exhibit P-5 statement before the Magistrate, the victim had clearly
stated that she was not examined by the police before which statement under Section 162 of the
Cr.P.C. was marked as exhibit 5. We cannot find that the testimony of the witness does not have a
ring of truth, and we find clear consent when she travelled with the accused. The police have also not
done anything to establish the exact date of marriage of the accused and though, his wife was
examined as PW 6. Her statement was only that she married the accused about one and half years
back. She specifically denied having visited the house of the victim and that she knew nothing about
the case. She denied her statements in exhibit P-4.
12. We cannot ignore that fact that even if there is a consent, the accused cannot be absolved of a
criminal liability if the child is a minor. No certificate to prove the date of birth of the victim is
produced before the Court nor has the parents, who were examined as PWs 1 and 2 asked any
question about the age of the child. PW 7 deposed before the Court that her date of birth is
04.03.1984 and that she was studying in intermediate in 2000-2001 which makes her age to be 17
years as on the date of the alleged abduction i.e. 03.05.2001; while a specific provision under
Section, 366A makes penal the inducement of a minor girl under the age of 18 years.
13. In this context, we have to examine Annexure A-9- evidence of the Medical Officer who claimed
that the age of the victim was between 16 to 17 years. The doctor specifically said that he referred
PW 7 to a Radiologist and based on the report, he issued certificate at exhibit P-7 certifying her age
to be between 16 to 17 years. Even in the case of ossification test, it was trite that there could be a
difference of two years, either way and in that circumstance, the age determination by the doctor as
between 16 to 17 years does not conclusively establish that the victim was a minor child at the time
of the alleged abduction. We cannot also but notice that the Radiologist was neither examined nor
was the his report marked in evidence. This seriously puts to peril the prosecution case that the
victim was a minor.
14. In the totality of the circumstances, we find absolutely no reason to affirm the conviction of the
appellant and we acquit him of the charges. Bail bonds, if any executed, shall stand cancelled.
15. Accordingly, the Appeal stands allowed as above. Parties to bear their own costs.
16. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
